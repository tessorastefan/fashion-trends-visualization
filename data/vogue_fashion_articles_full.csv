The Best Vintage Looks From the 2025 Awards Season,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/best-vintage-outfits-2025-awards-season,"February 18, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"When you think of awards season, you likely envision A-list stars hitting the red carpet in custom gowns and fresh-off-the-runway looks. But lately, vintage outfits have been all the rage in Hollywood. This awards season, we have seen a handful of stars embrace archival designs, proving that when well-styled, vintage silhouettes will always feel modern on the step and repeat. At the 2025 Golden Globes, Kylie Jenner sat alongside boyfriend Timothée Chalamet in a slinky Versace chainmail dress from the spring 1999 collection, famously worn by ElizabethHurley. (Jenner is no stranger to wearing vintage designer dresses: See some of her best throwback moments here.) Wicked star Ariana Grande also slipped into an archival design: a Givenchy couture gown from 1966. Its delicate beadwork and buttery yellow colorway felt retro, but not dated. Grande has, in fact, been sporting vintage silhouettes throughout awards season. At the Palm Springs Film Festival, Grande sported both an archival Chanel dress, as well as a vintage Christian Dior gown. More recently, at the Critics Choice Awards, Anora lead Mikey Madison chose a vintage black and white Armani gown from the label's fall 1992 collection. At the 2025 Grammys, Chappell Roan slipped into a charming Jean Paul Gaultier Couture dress from spring 2003, while Olivia Rodrigo went sleek and sexy in her black cutout Versace gown, from spring 2000. (Rodrigo is a big fan of archival designs.) As awards season continues on, you can be sure to see plenty more A-listers revive throwback designs. Of course, their decision to don vintage extends beyond just a fashion statement. By dipping into the archives, celebrities and their stylists have proved they are on board with recycling and rewearing, a form of fashion sustainability that's becoming increasingly common on the red carpets. It’s a thoughtful move: During awards season—when there’s so much pressure for celebrities to wear a plethora of extravagant looks—these vintage moments are a sartorial call for more consciousness on the red carpet (especially given that fashion and its supply chains have major impacts on the environment). To that we say, more vintage, please! Especially when it looks this good. Below, explore some of the best vintage looks from the 2025 awards season. In vintage Jean Paul Gaultier Couture (spring 2003) at the Grammys. In vintage Versace (spring 2000) at the Grammys. In vintage Armani (fall 1992) at the Critics Choice Awards.

The White Lotus Season 3 Fashion Is All About Loud Luxury,https://www.vogue.com/article/the-white-lotus-season-3-fashion-is-all-about-loud-luxury,"February 17, 2025",By Fawnia Soo Hoo,"Set on the picturesque island of Koh Samui, the third season of The White Lotus delivers plenty of immersive vacation porn as well as enviably audacious designer wardrobes on a new slate of badly behaving guests. “We don’t do quiet luxury,” says returning costume designer Alex Bovaird, who received two out of her three Emmy nominations for the first two seasons of the Mike White series. As a fresh set of potential Blossom Circle members take in the stunning views from the private boat to the resort, Raleigh, North Carolina, matriarch Victoria Ratliff (Parker Posey), tightly clutching her Gucci 1947 bamboo top-handle bag, turns down her nose at fellow guests—and the entire Thailand experience. With a bright blue silk scarf by Swaine London primly tied over the shoulders of her preppy Banana Republic shirtdress, Victoria wishes she was in England—or anywhere in western Europe—with her three children and sketchy financier husband Timothy (Jason Isaacs). “My inspiration for [the Ratliffs] was as if they just stepped out of a Ralph Lauren catalog,” says Bovaird. But Victoria did pack a suitcase, presumably checked first-class, of “loud Lilly Pulitzer”–esque dresses and floaty cover-ups, perfect for sipping mint juleps by a members-only pool. Bovaird referenced how the society set in Oxford, Mississippi, dress and the lifestyle of “the caftan queen of Birmingham, Alabama,” Susan Dumas. “She and her country club friends love vintage caftans,” says Bovaird, who also designed a resort-ready White Lotus–inspired collaboration with H&M. The eldest Ratliff sibling, Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger), thirsty for his withholding father’s approval, immediately telegraphs douchebag bro in one of his many Southern Tide polo shirts, wraparound Roger Federer sunglasses, and Gucci loafers sans socks. “His shorts are Brooks Brothers, and they’re just not the cool length,” says Bovaird. Younger sister Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook), who’s seeking spirituality on the island, hints at the burgeoning disconnect from her family with her ’80s-referential Ralph Lauren white lace dress. “She is a little bit more of the pure voice who’s looking for something more meaningful than her very materialistic family,” says Bovaird, who referenced a teenage Brooke Shields for Piper’s demure embroidered and lace-trimmed dresses. “[She’s] a bit more earthy, really wholesome, and a little more covered up.” Off to the side, a trio of 40-something childhood best friends giggle and gossip at the start of their decadent, and potentially debauched, reunion trip. In their coordinating sundresses, bags, and blonde highlights, they could be a girl group: TV actor Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan) in Alemais and Valentino; Austin socialite Kate (Leslie Bibb) in Paul Smith and Delvaux; and New York City lawyer Laurie (Carrie Coon) in Zimmermann and Loewe—check, check, and check. “They’re supposed to look interchangeable, but Laurie is the one who’s maybe trying to keep up with the girls,” says Bovaird. For the first-night dinner, Laurie dons a vintage Sue Wong watercolor-print jumpsuit, and later cries into her Giambattista Valli chain-link bag. Meanwhile, Kate, in red ruffle-tiered Lanvin, and Jaclyn, in a gold dragon-embroidered ’70s black vintage dress, trade fake, backhanded compliments. Jaclyn also employs her holiday as an opportunity for designer spon-con. “We imagined that she got a box of resort pieces that Valentino sent over. Maybe Kate grabbed a suit out of Jaclyn’s box,” says Bovaird. “Because that’s true to life—brands want to support actors.” For their first trip to the pool, Kate wraps a black-and-white panther-print sarong from the 2023 Escape collection around the waist of a Valentino hot pink maillot. Jaclyn, who’s regularly recognized by guests, appropriately called dibs on the showier, logo-mania pieces, like an oversized shirt cover-up and a flashy silver-sequined minidress. But odd couple Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood) and older boyfriend Rick (Walton Goggins) don’t quite fit in with the designer label–stacked façade of their fellow guests. “You’re supposed to bump up against them and think, Who are these two grifters? Because they are a little bit less put-together,” says Bovaird. “They seem like a couple of rogues. You’re just supposed to wonder what their story is, and they’re supposed to have a crackling sexual chemistry.” A grizzled Rick broods and smolders in a steady rotation of slouchy, halfway unbuttoned Hawaiian shirts, giving off the aura of an American expat with a questionable livelihood but deep pockets. Free-spirited Mancunian Chelsea takes selfies in a cutout My Beachy Side minidress. “She has this louche, sexy, Brigitte Bardot [vibe],” says Bovaird. “She’s been traveling for several years. We imagined she got the crochet dress from a market, or she collected things from Goa. She’s supposed to have this very market-driven, eclectic wardrobe.” Chelsea effortlessly mixes vintage with market-bought sarongs and minidresses, but her colorful bikinis are mostly by Corsica-based Tara Matthews. Chelsea also pairs a parrot-print vintage-looking Loewe wrap skirt with a throwback Blondie T-shirt, and carries JW Anderson and Louis Vuitton bags. “She has lots of sunglasses that she ‘got down at the market,’ but are actually by Jacquemus,” says Bovaird. Jacquemus also custom-designed two full looks for model Chloe (Charlotte LeBon), who a lonely Chelsea meets at the resort bar. (Keep an eye on Chloe’s “LBH”—“losers back home”—boyfriend, Gary, played by Jon Gries, who can’t seem to resist the nearest White Lotus location.) “[Jacquemus] designed special pieces just for The White Lotus in Thailand and hand-delivered them to Koh Samui,” says Bovaird about Chloe’s black-and-white polka-dotted bodysuit and striped, sequined skirt outfit that Chelsea admires, and a pink one-piece and sheer sarong for a yacht party. The White Lotus Maui spa manager Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) threads all three seasons of the slow-burn series together, as she spends a month at the Koh Samui outpost for a work-share session. She enjoys hands-on massage sessions with her very fit Thai counterpart, Pornchai (Dom Hetrakul)—and a resort wardrobe filled with colorful, tropical-print dresses and caftans from brands like Anthropologie and Verandah. “Belinda is a little self-conscious that she’s there on her work trip,” says Bovaird, who also custom-made looks with vibrant Thai fabrics for the character. “When she’s out of her uniform, she wants to feel as good as the guests.” Speaking of, what was it like putting Lalisa Manoban, aka Lisa of Blackpink, in a uniform to play resort staffer Mook? “I think it was refreshing for her not to worry too much about the bits and baubles, and making sure everything was super-fashionable,” says Bovaird. With the help of a local Thai crew, and input from Manoban, Bovaird custom-designed Mook’s blouse-and-sarong uniform. But the staffer first greets the guests in a cute palm-tree-and-monkey-embroidered short-sleeve shirt-and-shorts set that’s by Tombolo. “This season, we definitely upped our game,” says Bovaird. “We definitely had the right shoe for the right swimsuits, cover-ups, hats, bags, and sunglasses. Whereas, in season one, we were like, ‘Here are your flip-flops.’” Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

Ayo Edebiri Wore New York Fashion Week’s Rising Star for SNL 50,https://www.vogue.com/article/ayo-edebiri-snl-colleen-allen-new-york-fashion-week-rising-star,"February 18, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"It’s no secret that Ayo Edebiri quickly ascended to one of Hollywood’s best dressers in almost no time. While the actor has courted brands from Loewe to Prada, she’s always down to push the envelope with more avant-garde labels—with a helping hand from her stylist, Danielle Goldberg. Now, she’s the first to wear a brand-new piece from one of New York Fashion Week’s fast-rising stars, Colleen Allen. Edebiri was among the dozens of stars who participated in SNL’s 50th anniversary special over the weekend. The actor, who hosted the show in February 20204 returned to the hallowed halls of 30 Rock, joining Robert DeNiro, Drew Barrymore, Jimmy Fallon, and Rachel Dratch in a reprisal of “Debbie Downer.” Ayo Edebiri Colleen Allen fall 2025, look 2. The sketch was a black-tie affair, and Edebiri tapped Allen for the occasion, choosing a piece from the designer’s fall 2025 collection: a floor-length black velvet dress featuring a plunging, smocked neckline, which Edebiri styled with a black Sophie Buhai choker with a silver pendant. The dress debuted at NYFW just last week in an appointment-only presentation that my colleague José Criales-Unzueta described as “New York’s hottest club.” While Ayo Edebiri may not have been among the fashion editors who oohed and ahhed over Allen’s sumptuous velvets and rich color palette in person, she reminded us at SNL that she’s always got her finger on the pulse.

The Biggest Stars on the Front Row of London Fashion Week,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/celebrities-front-row-london-fashion-week,"February 21, 2025",By Daisy Jones,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Ah, London Fashion Week. It may not be as polished and starry as its New York counterpart, or as refined and sexy as its cousins across the channel, Paris and Milan…But what it lacks in glossiness, it more than makes up for in fun, grit, and playfulness. (Or so the common narrative goes, though the cliché exists for a reason). Amid all the fall winter 2025 madness, it can be easy to forget that LFW didn’t even exist before 1984, back when PR guru Lynne Franks had the galaxy-brained idea of putting together a schedule featuring the likes of Vivienne Westwood, Katharine Hamnett, and little-known Central Saint Martins graduate John Galliano. In the decades since, LFW has of course become a cultural behemoth, kickstarting and showcasing the careers of everyone from Simone Rocha to Martine Rose and Wales Bonner. But as we know, LFW isn’t just for fashion nerds, industry heads, and journos. Celebs love to be seen on the front row, and frankly we love to see them too. (Prior highlights include: Anna Wintour next to Queen Elizabeth II at Richard Quinn in 2018, Pamela Anderson next to a white statue at Vivienne Westwood in 2008 and all of the increasingly rare glimpses of Harry Styles). And with the likes of Harris Reed and CSM’s class of 2025 kicking us off on the Thursday, LFW has only just begun. To that end, scroll through the gallery below to see all the biggest stars in attendance at the fall winter 2025 edition of London Fashion Week.

Why Are We So Obsessed With Celebrity Court Style?,https://www.vogue.com/article/celebrity-court-fashion,"February 19, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Yesterday, A$AP Rocky was found not guilty in a felony assault trial. Over the course of the court proceedings—which spanned nearly four weeks—Rocky retained his reputation as one of the most stylish celebrities, showing up every day in impeccably tailored suits: pinstripes, trench coats, structured shoulders, and wide legs. He was so well-dressed—and in so much Saint Laurent—that his morning walks to the courthouse may as well have been an ad campaign. It wasn’t the first time the public has consumed—grimly or voyeuristically—what celebrities and people in the public eye wear to court, and it certainly won’t be the last. In September 2024, Justin Timberlake arrived at the Sag Harbor municipal court to plead guilty to driving while impaired, for which he was arrested in June. (The charge came with a 90-day license suspension, 25 hours of community service, and a $500 fine.) The incident was heavily memed thanks to reports that the arresting officer didn’t know who the singer was, which came to light mid-arrest when Timberlake muttered, “This is going to ruin the tour.” When asked what tour, he said, “The world tour.” With so much public attention on the case, Timberlake and his stylist, Jason Bolden, surely put consideration into his court attire. He wore a black crewneck T-shirt underneath a black V-neck cardigan with brown trousers, and leather shoes. But most surprising was his choice of accessory: a double strand of pearls. Timberlake has been wearing traditionally feminine jewelry lately, as have the likes of Harry Styles, Usher, Shawn Mendes, A$AP Rocky, and Pharrell Williams—a growing trend among male actors and musicians. The pearl necklace in particular has become a softboy-coded accessory. It’s also a relatively new symbol of Timberlake’s onstage persona. But is court really the place for an emblem of his popstar style? Others have taken different approaches to court style. In 2023, celebrities in the courtroom seem of more interest than ever, between the popularity of Jury Duty—which starred James Marsden as a satirized version of himself—Kim Kardashian doing her civic duty by reporting for her own jury duty, and Gwyneth Paltrow’s highly memed ski trial. In November 2023, the writer E. Jean Carroll was awarded $83.3 million after a jury found Donald Trump liable of defamation for disparaging statements he made in 2019, following claims that he sexually assaulted her. For her final day in court, Carroll stuck to her longtime outfit formula: a black turtleneck paired with a black pleated skirt; a white brocade blazer cinched with a black belt; opaque black stockings; and a cream overcoat. She carried with her a chestnut-colored briefcase. On this day of victory, Carroll opted for an eye-catching pair of black and white heeled Oxfords. The last time she wore this outfit was during her May 2023 trial against the former president, where he was also found liable for sexually assaulting and defaming her. The fascination with celebrity court style is far from new. In the fall of 2002, Winona Ryder appeared in court in a seemingly unassuming dress: a black long-sleeve with a pink and white trompe l’oeil collar and an A-line skirt that fell below the knee from Marc Jacobs’s fall 2001 collection. While the dress would generally be considered a perfectly demure court attire, it became an instant lightning rod for controversy. Ryder was on trial for shoplifting $5,500 of merchandise from Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills—Marc Jacobs clothing among the items stolen. The sheer audacity of the look, however, paid off: In May 2002, Ryder appeared on the cover of W in a “Free Winona” graphic tee, and even starred in Jacobs’s spring 2003 campaign. Celebrity trials are a way for many to see larger-than-life figures attempt to conduct themselves under pressure, some during the lowest moments of their lives. When famous people publicly contend with the fact that they are not above the law, their sartorial choices can go in a couple directions. Some opt for more modest, neutral clothing that seeks to humanize, making them seem respectful and serious; or they lean into their personae, dressing for the attention that they know they’re already bound to receive. Some don’t take well to the pressure. During a 2010 probation meeting and sentencing for missing counseling sessions related to her 2007 DUI, Lindsay Lohan wore a court-appropriate outfit of a black cowl neck, black trousers, peep-toe pumps, and a gray cardigan. But written over her nail polish on her middle finger was an expletive message. Others rise to the occasion. Earlier this year, Gwyneth Paltrow stood trial in Deer Valley, Utah, after she was sued for $300,000 by retired optometrist Terry Sanderson over a 2016 ski collision; Paltrow countersued for $1 and legal fees. (Sanderson was found at fault.) While the trial was largely considered a waste of time, Paltrow’s attire caught many people’s eyes. The Goop founder leaned into the après ski chic, wearing neutral sweaters, long pleated skirts, and sleek suits. With her expert tailoring and accessorizing, Paltrow’s stealth wealth wardrobe proved that court wear can be chic, too. Cardi B, however, ran in the opposite direction. While the rapper avoided the media circus of a trial by pleading guilty to two charges stemming from a strip club fight, she still had her day in court. For her arraignment, she wore a navy and pink suit with seemingly no undershirt, and carried a neon pink and white Birkin. Earlier this year after she failed to meet the requirements of her plea deal, she returned to court in a sweeping black feathered coat with a lengthy train, a white button-up with a skinny black tie, Louboutins, and an oversized fuzzy black hat. On another occasion, she opted for a tight white long-sleeved dress with white Louboutins, and a floor-length white fur coat. Some derided the looks as making a mockery of the justice system, while others deemed them instantly iconic—a display of Cardi B remaining unwaveringly true to herself. Courtroom style can make or break how a defendant is perceived by the judge, jury, and the court of public opinion, and celebrities know better than anybody about the power of perception. As Alexis Neiers knows all too well, the difference between $29 four-inch Bebe heels and six-inch Louboutins is astronomical. Paris Hilton pled guilty on two misdemeanors, drug possession and obstructing an officer. Naomi Campbell at her 2006 trial for second-degree assault after she allegedly threw a cell phone at her housekeeper. Martha Stewart carries a Birkin while on trial for obstruction of justice, 2004.

Behold! Every Taylor Swift Outfit From the 2024-2025 NFL Season,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/every-taylor-swift-outfit-2024-2025-nfl-season#intcid=_vogue-verso-hp-trending_920a9351-cae8-486c-a7ac-8b0b1cbd72ad_popular4-1,"January 26, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"It’s a Sunday evening in America, and that only means one thing: Taylor Swift is at the Kansas City Chiefs game. For the second season in a row, the singer is cheering on her boyfriend, Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce. Tonight, Swift was spotted attending the Chiefs-versus-Buffalo Bills game in a bold monogrammed Louis Vuitton look including a logo jacket, bag, and boots. Ever the supportive partner, Swift often comes decked out in team colors. On some occasions, she leans all the way into WAG territory (for the team’s game against the Bengals on September 15, she wore a Chiefs tee with thigh-high black boots), while on other nights she embraces her more high-fashion side, like the denim Versace corset top she wore for the game against the Baltimore Ravens. For a game against the New Orleans Saints, Swift turned out a full Vivienne Westwood ensemble, wearing an off-the-shoulder sweetheart corset and miniskirt in a matching gray-and-red tartan from fall 2024, which she paired with knee-high black leather platform boots and a small purse emblazoned with Westwood’s telltale orb insignia. (The corset has proven itself a particularly popular piece as of late: just last month former First Daughter Malia Obama also wore it to the Deauville Film Festival in France.) Beyond the fabulous fashion, she opted for a spirited beauty look, adding a smattering of glitter across her face to her signature red lip. Swift is also liable to mix sporty style with more fashion-forward elements. On the November 4 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, she paired her Kansas City leather jacket with a Dior Saddle bag and a Chanel necklace. On November 29, she stepped out for the Black Friday game in a red Louis Vuitton half-zip sweater, Dana Rebecca Designs hoops, and a custom “87” necklace in honor of Travis Kelce’s jersey number. Though, at the December 21 game against the Houston Texans, Swift channeled her inner Penny Lane (in Kansas City colors though, obviously) in a red shearling coat, which she styled with a black velvet vintage Chanel bucket hat. While we recognize the average Vogue reader may be a bit less invested in their fantasy football league than they are their fantasy creative director bracket, we can surely all appreciate the fashions that Swift brings to Kansas City. So, with that, follow along throughout the 2024-2025 NFL season as we chronicle every outfit Taylor Swift wears to cheer on the Kansas City Chiefs. Wearing a monogrammed Louis Vuitton jacket, bag, and shoes. Wearing a Charlotte Simone coat, vintage Chanel bucket hat, Tods bag, and Manolo Blahnik boots. In a Louis Vuitton half-zip sweater, Paige jeans, Dana Rebecca Designs hoops, and a custom “87” necklace. In a Chiefs jacket, corset top, knee-high Chrisitan Louboutin cowboy boots, Dior Saddle bag, and Chanel necklace. In Vivienne Westwood. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

Who Pays for the Wedding? A Guide to Cost-Splitting,https://www.vogue.com/article/who-pays-for-the-wedding-etiquette-rules#intcid=_vogue-verso-hp-trending_920a9351-cae8-486c-a7ac-8b0b1cbd72ad_popular4-1,"January 25, 2025",By Priya Rao,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Newly engaged? You’re probably ready to book a venue and buy a dream dress. But first, there’s one major question you have to address: who pays for the wedding? Determining your wedding budget is an essential first step in planning your celebration, but it's important to understand who can contribute to the costs of the day. While weddings were often paid by the couple's parents in the past, the tides have changed. “These days, anything goes when it comes to paying for a wedding. Engaged couples taking care of the finances is on the rise,” says Kylie Carlson, the CEO of the International Academy of Wedding & Event Planning. “At the same time, the tradition of the bride’s parents contributing is still very prevalent, especially in particular regions. With some weddings, costs are split between the couples and other members of the family. You’ll also run into scenarios where parents are divorced or remarried, and splitting the costs. Grandparents may chip in—it really does depend on each individual wedding.” When it comes to nuptials, it truly works on a case-by-case basis. As you navigate your own wedding, budget, and cost-splitting, here are some things to keep in mind as you figure out who pays for what. According to traditional wedding etiquette, the bride’s family assumes most of the financial costs associated with a wedding, including the wedding planner, invitations, dress, ceremony, reception, flowers, photography, and music. “It’s harder to think about this now—and I am a feminist—but historically it has to do with the ancient practice of a bride’s family giving a dowry to the groom for assuming the ‘burden’ of a bride,” says Lizzie Post, co-president of the Emily Post Institute (and the great-great-granddaughter of Emily Post). The bride’s parents also traditionally hosted the engagement party. The groom’s family traditionally paid for all costs associated with the rehearsal dinner and honeymoon, wedding day transportation, and the officiant. The groom also paid for the bride’s engagement ring, wedding ring, and groomsmen gifts. It is also common for the groom’s family to pay for the alcohol at the reception. Yet it’s important to remember this adage from Emily Post’s Wedding Etiquette guide: “Traditions make weddings special, and a spending plan should be something that facilitates these traditions, not a burden to be held against an old and outdated standard.” If certain family members are covering the majority of wedding costs, their contributions are traditionally noted on the invitations. “If the bride’s family is paying for the wedding, their name should come first and almost exclusively,” says Post. For example, the invitation would then begin with something like: “Dr. and Mrs. Arthur Smith request the honor of your presence at the wedding of their daughter Mary Ann to Everett Montgomery.” If both sets of parents are paying, you can opt for wording like: “Charles and Delaney Tout and Harold and Claudia Kohn invite you to celebrate with their children Amelia and Stephen.” Ahead, we break down the traditional breakdown of wedding costs. It's important to note that these traditions vary by the family's background. While Western weddings typically follow this division of financial responsibility, both Chinese and Russian cultures swap the standard with the groom's family paying for the majority of the wedding. For same-sex or non-binary couples, the rules are much more fluid. The wedding could be split evenly amongst the couple's families or be paid for by themselves. It is best for the bride and groom to have a private discussion first before speaking to their parents about helping to cover costs. “Please, please talk about costs up front,” says East Coast event expert Rebecca Gardner. Post agrees. She advises couples to then delicately broach the subject with family members. “It is best to phrase it as, ‘We were wondering if you would like to contribute to the wedding,’” Post suggests, adding that couples should emphasize that they are “not expecting anything.” If parents are willing to contribute, ask them to be clear about their expectations and what they are, or aren’t, willing to pay for. “Communication is key to keeping the peace. The last thing you want is a misunderstanding and you find yourself coming up short, or someone feeling like they need to contribute more than they expected,” adds Carlson. If your family is helping to significantly foot the bill, you might find yourself in tricky situations where they are insisting on their way rather than your way. If you can foresee that happening, you may want to consider taking care of the expenses yourself. “You’ll be far calmer having the wedding you want on your terms, even if you ultimately end up scaling back the festivities,” says Carlson. Today, more couples are directly contributing to the wedding. Simultaneously, more grooms’ families are also willing to split costs. Want specific statistics? According to a recent survey by The Knot, on average, parents contribute to 50% of the wedding budget, while couples pay the remaining half. Meanwhile, Zola found that one-third of couples are covering all of their wedding costs on their own. Curious if older couples are expected to pay more? “Age has very little to do with paying for the wedding,” says Carlson. “It’s really more about how financially sound the couple is on their own, as well as the role their family wants to play in the wedding.” Post agrees: “Age shouldn’t be a factor when contributing. Whether you are getting married in your 40s or 30s or 20s, a parent should want to help, as long as it is financially viable for them.” Wondering how to word invitations if the couple pays? If the bride and groom are paying for the wedding, then only their names need to be on the invite. If it is a combination of the couple and parents, something like the following works, according to Emily Post’s Etiquette Centennial: “Together with our families, Casey Collet and Felix Edgers invite you to join in celebrating their marriage.” In addition to the small duties of providing emotional support or searching for the groom's missing bowtie, a wedding party member may also be expected to contribute financially to a portion of the events. Traditionally, the wedding party will pay for their own personal attire and a gift for the couple. They are also expected to pay for their own travel to the wedding. In some cases, a couple and their families may help cover the costs of their lodging, but it's not expected. There also is the question of how the wedding party will contribute to other events. If invited to a shower, the attending wedding party member will be expected to bring a gift. A maid of honor may also pay for the costs of a bridal shower if she is hosting, or split the bill with one or multiple of the bride’s family members who offer to co-host. If attending a bachelor or bachelorette party, the wedding party member will be expected to pay for their travel and a portion of othe verall costs for the event. \ Forget Lake Como—Here’s Why You Should Visit the Charming Lake Lugano Instead The Biggest Color Trends in Interiors in 2025 I Stayed at the Hotel in The White Lotus Season 3—Here’s What It’s Really Like The Best Restaurants in Midtown Manhattan Never miss a Vogue moment and get unlimited digital access for just $2 $1 per month.

The Best Vintage Stores in Dallas Fort Worth,https://www.vogue.com/article/the-best-vintage-stores-in-dallas-fort-worth,"April 22, 2024",By Margaux Anbouba,"Vogue’s guide to the best vintage stores in Dallas/Fort Worth is part of our directory of the very best vintage around the world, curated by editors from all over. Whether you’re traveling and searching for some superb stores to visit on your trip or are curious about your local vintage treasure chests, Vogue’s directory has you covered. Thanks to Beyoncé, we're in a bit of a Texas renaissance. And while the Dallas/Forth Worth area is a fantastic place to find vintage Justin cowboy boots, authentic turquoise jewelry, and a rainbow of broken-in Levis, that's not all the city has to offer. The home of the first Neiman Marcus and a huge art scene has a long and storied history of loving fashion—and now, vintage lovers can reap the benefits. If you're into hitting up an estate sale (certainly worth it if one piques your interest), try any of these shops to find something of your own from The Big D. First, Caitlin Brax will look you up and down. Next, you'll do a little spin—and then Brax, known locally as “the denim whisperer,” will send you off to the dressing room with an arm full of Levis, Gloria Vanderbilts, and Wranglers (of course, it is Texas after all) that all remarkably just fit. Address: 2811 North Henderson Ave, Dallas You never know what you're going to find when you wander into this flea market-style store. Founded by Gretchen Bell in 2005, the first half of the shop is dedicated to racks upon racks of men's and women's clothing, all divided out by type and era—then further broken down into modern sizing—so it's easy to find what you're looking for. To the left, you'll find a large assortment of cowboy boots and smaller booths that are more like Pandora's (vintage) box: Velvet Elvis paintings, taxidermy mice wearing tutus, and leopard skin pillbox hats are just a few of the odd delights. Address: 1914 North Haskell Avenue, Dallas Located upon Dallas's “little sister” city, Denton's lively town square, this jewel box focuses on selling pieces of femme fatale history. There are 1940s peplum suits next to ‘80s Victor Costa gowns, Mad Men-style everything (down to the undergarments!), and a large assortment of accessories to complete every ensemble. With practically no online presence, your best bet is to just stop by—that's part of the vintage adventure. Address: 121 North Elm Street, Denton Founded by Daniel Brown in 2019, Nylo Wool is where the Marlboro man's closet has been curated for the next generation. You'll find it stocked with wares loved by true cowboys, like H Bar C pearl snap shirts, deeply broken-in overalls (patches included) from the 1940s, and an overall focus on plaid, flannels, and western wear that… is actual, authentically sourced from the west. Address: 3107 Commerce Street, Dallas Shop founder Katie White has an uncanny ability to pair prairie skirts with vintage Harley Davidson t-shirts in a way that has customers gravitating to this Bishop Arts shop in droves. Delicate lace dresses and handmade frocks, along with Gunne Sax everything, are frequently found on the racks, along with a large selection of coveralls and band tees. Through the back door, you'll find Brass Tacks Barber Shop, an old-school shop owned by White's husband, Brandon. Address: 330 West Davis Street, Suite #101, Dallas After spending 25 years wearing a law enforcement uniform, Studio 74 founder Laura Simmons is now going full-on technicolor. Her vibrant, western-inspired tastes are reflected in the store's stock. Inside the Forth Worth store you'll find hand-embroidered rodeo uniforms, dresses appropriate for chore work and debutant balls, and fringe—so much fringe. Address: 5926 Curzon Ave, Fort Worth Opened in 1999 by founders Ken Weber and Greg Kelly, this is really three shops in one: A well-stocked vintage store with garments from the 1800s onward; a consignment business with more modern finds like hard-to-find pieces from Chanel and Hermès previously loved by the city's well-heeled residents; and most recently, a dedicated men's store located next door.

The Best Vintage Stores in Milan,https://www.vogue.com/article/best-vintage-stores-in-milan,"April 22, 2024",By Selene Oliva,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Vogue’s guide to the best vintage stores in Milan is part of our directory of the very best vintage around the world, curated by editors from all over. Whether you’re traveling and searching for some superb stores to visit on your trip or are curious about your local vintage treasure chests, Vogue’s directory has you covered. Vintage lives outside the fashion universe—it exists beyond trends. It can represent a desire for renewal, the conversion of old to new, and, more poetically, adolescent reveries realized. There’s no greater satisfaction than buying the garment or accessory coveted in preteen years spent pouring over magazines. But where does the best vintage really live? Fashion capitals, of course. Milan is now a hotbed of vintage activity. Tucked away in picturesque urban postcards, behind Piazza Castello, or just a stone’s throw from the Columns of San Lorenzo, Milan’s vintage boutiques are a must-visit destination for those who experience fashion in Milan. To narrow down the city’s vintage highlights, we’ve assembled Vogue’s guide to the best vintage in Milan, curated with the help of our editors at Italian Vogue. You’ll find treasures in the cavernous wonders of Madame Pauline Vintage, a destination for vintage lovers and collectors of irreverent retro wares. Luring every generation with its offerings, the boutique is a must-visit address for both socialites and It girls and impeccable ladies of Milanese style—you know the types: silver hair, brooch on the chest, and heirloom bag on the wrist. With carefully selected offerings, the store also creates custom collections, including Bandana, a favorite among Madame’s most beloved frequenters. Address: Foro Buonaparte 74, 20121 Milan An institution for vintage treats and its archive fabrics, colors, and inspirations, Cavalli e Nastri is one of Milan's most celebrated vintage stores. The store is like a whirlwind fashion history tour from 1920s hats à la Louise Brooks to 1950s housemaid Corolle skirts to the unabashedly glamorous 1990s Versace. A Mecca for designers and stylists, the boutique has the intimacy you’d expect of a tea room with its soft music, shapes, and colors. Address: Via Gian Giacomo Mora, 3, 20123 Milan Located in a courtyard in old Milan and furnished with period furniture, Franco Jacassi’s Vintage Delirium opened in 1985 and has since become one of the world’s most extensive collections of vintage clothing. Beyond that, it’s also a trove for fashion researchers with its sizable selection of couture and vintage fabrics; the boutique features a fantastic button collection with more than 50,000 designs, as well as a true archive of magazines, buckles, antique appliqués, and much more. Address: Via Giuseppe Sacchi, 3, 20121 Milan Manuel Menini’s personal wunderkammer, Vincent Vintage Bijoux in Porta Venezia, holds an endless collection of vintage jewelry and costume jewelry, with a particular focus on the Georgian period. An ideal stop for jewelry aficionados, the boutique knows how to surprise with its theatrical displays that bring each individual piece to life. For those nostalgic for the Golden Age of jewelry, the store is the place for British and 19th-century styles. Address: Via Lazzaro Spallanzani, 11, 20129 Milan, tel. 3389743349 A destination for all those (of any age!) in their teenage rebellion phase Groupies is a nonconformist’s paradise. The shop focuses on street style, with an emphasis on the 1990s and 2000s. Between printed short-sleeved shirts and PVC bijoux straight out of our childhood manga dreams, it’s the perfect place to indulge in fun-filled shopping. Address: Via Gian Giacomo Mora, 7, 20123 Milan Tucked away in a side street of Piazza XXIV Maggio, PWC Milano is the location for club kids in Milan and beyond. The boutique’s assortment is consistent but not predictable, offering its coterie of loyal customers both the Cher Horowitz–inspired silk slip dress and the tie-dye prints to wear with black patent leather platform boots. The pièce de résistance is the accessories station, where Regency-style velvet bonnets and cloth brooches are merchandised alongside a total-leather look. Address: Via Pietro Custodi, 12, 20136 Milan Located somewhere between past and present on Corso Garibaldi, Lipstick Vintage has a flamboyant selection of ready-to-wear creations and endless accessories. Their wide assortment caters to everyone from the inconsolable romantic to the minimalists who refuse to wear color. The boutique offers its patrons muses of elegance, from the Mona Lisa to Cate Blanchett, and suggestions to mimic their style. Address: Corso Garibaldi, 79, 20121 Milan Much more than a vintage store; at Bivio, you can buy and sell your designer pieces. The store’s buyers buy exclusively from individuals, selecting pieces one by one and offering the seller the double option of receiving cash or a coupon to spend at the boutique—which wouldn’t be difficult to do. Address: Via Gian Giacomo Mora 4, 20123 Milan Just a stone’s throw from the art and design hub of Via Ventura, 20134Lambrate found its home beneath a 1940s barbershop sign. It’s the address to know if your wardrobe tends to mish-mash era; inside, 20th-century garments are shown on a mannequin adorned with 1980s accessories. And since fashion-lovers tend to love beauty in all its forms, there's a color-filled selection of furniture and furnishings such as lamps, chairs, vases, and mirrors. Address: Via Conte Rosso, 22, 20134 Milan Though it opened in the 1990s, stepping into Lo Specchio di Alice is not unlike stepping into Lewis Carroll’s looking glass—only here, you’re in a world where the 1960s never ended. Shoppers will fashion memorabilia from the past, from Cherokee belts to hand-painted bomber jackets, from twist-dancing shoes to biker boots. It’s a space for true explorers—customers could spend hours searching for the perfect purchase among hundreds and hundreds of offerings. Address: Corso di Porta Ticinese, 64, 20123 Milan Humana (also shoppable online) sees vintage as a way to live sustainably, but the store does much more than offer secondhand clothes—Humana is, in fact, a humanitarian organization founded in 1998 which (through the sale of its secondhand clothes) supports education, sustainable agriculture, health protection, and community development projects in Italy and beyond. The stores are filled with clothing, accessories, jewelry, and Italian fashion items from the ’60s to the present day. Address: Via Cappellari, 3, 20123 Milan Opened in 2010 and located in the Navigli district, Sous Vintage takes the concept of second-hand to the next level, offering not only pre-loved clothing and accessories but also hosting collections and events by young indie creatives who upcycle discarded fabrics and materials to create something new. The shop was the brainchild of Eva Fiorucci and Carolina Ferrari. Address: Alzaia Naviglio Pavese, 52, 20143 Milan More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

The Best Vintage Stores in São Paulo,https://www.vogue.com/article/best-vintage-stores-in-sao-paulo,"April 22, 2024",By Lilah Ramzi,"Vogue’s guide to the best vintage stores in São Paulo is part of our directory of the very best vintage around the world, curated by editors from all over. Whether you’re traveling and searching for some superb stores to visit on your trip or are curious about your local vintage treasure chests, Vogue’s directory has you covered. Is vintage what you think about when you think of São Paulo? It very well should be! The city is leading the secondhand and archival scene in Brazil—and South America, for that matter—with a handful of stores that satisfy a variety of vintage flights of fancy. For those looking for an emporium of theatrical vintage fashion, there is a store for that (head to Casa Juisi). If you’re less interested in older fashion and looking for more recent designer labels, there are plenty of superb options for that too (see Pretty New and Take Me Vintage.) If you enjoy the hunt and sifting through boutiques that offer a combination of the two, then Frou Frou is the store for you. It’s a fashionable choose-your-own-adventure, and to help you narrow it down, we’ve compiled a list of the best vintage stores in São Paulo, curated with the help of our editors at Vogue Brazil. Founded in 2007 by Paula Rondon and Gil França, B. Luxo is stocked with vintage pieces collected from around the world. It is a destination for no-label vintage, predominantly from the ’60s, ’70s, and ’80s. Inside the store, there are wunderkammers filled with antique jewelry, glass bell jars containing vintage accessories, and a fair amount of taxidermy birds adding to the fashion cabinet-of-curiosity vibes. The mood carries over online, where a superb selection of their wares is listed for sale. Address: R. Augusta, 2294 - Sala 22 - Cerqueira César, São Paulo - SP, 01412-100 Introducing Casa Juisi, a São Paulo institution that has long lured fashion history buffs and vintage enthusiasts to the city’s center. Here, you’ll find archival gems like Moschino’s silverware-laden jacket from 1989 and nautical ’80s fashions by Zandra Rhodes, but also American marching band costumes, theatrical opera gowns, and more. It’s a hodgepodge assortment with a common denominator of fabulousness. Address: R. Roberto Simonsen, 108 - Sé, São Paulo - SP, 01017-020 Founded in 2007 by mother-and-daughter duo Luzia Belucci and Giovanna Belucci, Frou Frou Vintage is a collection of vintage and secondhand products they’ve sourced from around the globe. Its mission is to promote the second (and third!) lives of all their pieces through affordably priced pieces for sale or rent. Inside, you’ll find a delightful mix of styles—disco balls hang from the ceiling, Persian rugs line the floors, and hats fill up every available space on the walls. Assortment-wise, it’s half thrift store and half designer vintage; shop pieces from the ’70s, ’80s, ’90s, and ’00s by Courrèges, Prada, Glória Coelho, Huis Clos, Reinaldo Lourenço, Bottega Veneta, Cacharel, Comme des Garçons, and more. Address: R. Augusta, 725 - 2 - Consolação São Paulo - SP, 01305-100 This store’s name, Minha Avó Tinha (meaning “My Grandmother Had” in Portuguese), sums things up perfectly. This is not your label-laden vintage store but a collection of early 20th-century pieces that your grandmother just might have actually hand. This Art Deco jewelry, lace shirting, woolen A-line skirts, boxy-shouldered blazers. All of this is displayed alongside vintage decor and furniture that adds to the ambiance but is also for sale. It had all the charm of a thrift store but all the presentation (and organization!) of a high-end designer vintage salon. Address: R. Tomé de Souza, 100 - Lapa, São Paulo - SP, 05079-000 For secondhand designer fashion, New4another is a well-stocked boutique and e-boutique frequented by São Paulo’s fashion crowd. The store, which is decorated in shades of sage green, is pristinely organized with shoes, accessories, wallets, and clothing galore in excellent condition. You won't find vintage-vintage here but you will find a great, barely-worn Zimmermann dress you can wear to your next outing. Address: R. Campo Verde, 61 - Conj 72 - Jardim Europa São Paulo - SP, 01456-010 Colors! Texture! Mood! And we're not even talking about the clothes. Pretty New’s punchy boutique is a delight to visit. The HQ for a second-hand resale site is stocked with high-end labels—in this one corner, you'll clock Loewe, Balenciaga, Chanel, Veronica Beard, and more. Founded by Gabriella Constantino Leal in 2014, the store is curated with current-season trends, and there's even a never-worn but not new section. It's the next best thing—better?—to shopping firsthand fashion in SP. Address: Av. Nove de Julho, 4865 - Jardim Paulista, São Paulo - SP, 01407-200 Conveniently located in a shopping mall behind a nondescript wooden door (IYKYK), Take Me Vintage is a sprawling emporium for secondhand designer fashions. Shoppable in-store and online, Take Me Vintage is more designer-secondhand than vintage, but there are plenty of runway pieces and heirlooms in the making up for grabs. Clothing is organized by color and vibe, and the shoes playfully line the store, winding all the way up the sets to the upper floor. Address: Shopping Cidade Jardim Av.

The Best Vintage Stores in Beirut,https://www.vogue.com/article/best-vintage-stores-in-beirut,"April 22, 2024",By Lilah Ramzi,"Vogue’s guide to the best vintage stores in Beirut is part of our directory of the very best vintage around the world, curated by editors from all over. Whether you’re traveling and searching for some superb stores to visit on your trip or are curious about your local vintage treasure chests, Vogue’s directory has you covered. Beirut has long been on the fashion map—Elie Saab, Zuhair Murad, Sandra Mansour, Georges Chakra, need we say more? But it's a city that's also at the forefront of all things vintage fashion. Across the seaside town, you'll find a variety of vintage, second-hand, and thrift shops to visit, from the label-laden GarageLuxe to the gorgeously curated vintage store Nouvelle Vague Vintage. And given Beirut is also known for its thriving nightlife—it needs to be experienced to be believed—there are shops like Depot-Vente filled with pieces to help get you dressed for the part. Below, our guide to the best vintage stores in Hong Kong, curated with the help of our editors at Vogue Arabia. Established in 2013, GarageLuxe describes itself as Lebanon's first major online consignment network. A decade later, the company (which uses the term “re-commerce”) has expanded and opened a glossy brick-and-mortar in Beirut's tony Achrafieh Mall. The resale platform is filled with labels and archival secondhand fashion (don't expect too much “vintage”) from all the top labels—you'll find Chanel, Hermès, and Dior bags galore. Address: ABC Achrafieh Mall, Level L1, STR 2065, Alfred Naccache, Beirut Set in Beirut's nightlife quarter of Gemmayze, you'll find a white neon sign calling you into Nouvelle Vague Vintage, which was founded by vintage collector Tatiana Fayad. The goal? To democratize vintage fashion across the Middle East—Fayad is never not picking merchandise for her store. Expect decades-old designer pieces that are incredibly well-priced and covetable. There is also no-label vintage from the ’60s, ’70s, and beyond that will tickle the fancy of any vintage lover. Address: 268 Gouraud Street, Gemmayze, Beirut “Pls note we don’t buy clothes from individuals, and don’t accept items on consignment,” reads the Instagram bio of Depot-Vente. Read: This is not your typical re-sale shop. Founded in 2013 in Nawal Akl, Depot-Vente is a premiere vintage shop located in Beirut’s hip Mar Mikhael neighborhood. This depot-style store does indeed feel like a depot, only it's stocked with vintage pieces from the ’60s all the way to 2000s. There's a look that Akl also considered when sourcing her pieces—youthful club and party-ready pieces ready for a night out. Address: Khalil Badawi, Beirut Vintage Soul 101 isn't in Beirut—it's technically just north in Jounieh. It's also not a vintage store, per se, but it's still worth adding to a list of vintage stores since it carries both secondhand and upcycled pieces (bags, tops, and more) made from deadstock fabrics. You can find vintage fashion capital F (Givenchy blazers; Escada jackets), but the draw here is really the upcycled and pieced-together separates that mish fabrics together brilliantly. Address: Vintage Soul 101, Sarba Second Base is a charity thrift shop created in 2017 by FabricAID, one of Lebanon’s leading social enterprises, which collects and redistributes clothes to disadvantaged communities throughout the country. They fund their mission with the sales of their “vintage, hipster, revealing, and extroverted clothing items” out of a storefront in Beirut.

The Best Vintage Stores in Tokyo,https://www.vogue.com/article/best-vintage-stores-in-tokyo,"April 22, 2024",By Margaux Anbouba,"Vogue’s guide to the best vintage stores in Tokyo is part of our directory of the very best vintage around the world, curated by editors from all over. Whether you’re traveling and searching for some superb stores to visit on your trip or are curious about your local vintage treasure chests, Vogue’s directory has you covered. A trip to Tokyo is a bucket-list item for many, especially if you love designer vintage. Strict anti-counterfeit laws make it a dream for those looking to purchase rare bags from the Marc Jacobs era of Louis Vuitton, perfectly pristine Chanel tweed suits, or even an Hermès Birkin bag (there are many stores completely dedicated to them)—but there’s also the Americana movement currently happening there, which has made brands like Carhartt, Doc Martens, and Tommy Hilfiger in high demand. As the scene continues to grow, so will this list. But here’s where to start with the best vintage stores in Tokyo curated with the help of our editors at Vogue Japan. Beloved by celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Black Pink, and Vogue’s very own Christian Allaire, this is a must-stop destination for designer handbags, accessories, and clothing. We suggest making an appointment so you can skip the line—after that, there’s two ways to approach an appointment: Come with dream bag in mind (Casanova’s selection of rare Chanels is particularly fantastic) or with an open mind and go home with something unexpected. Address: 〒150-0001 Tokyo, Shibuya City, Jingumae, 5 Chome−12−10 鈴木ハイツ １F Pristine Hermès scarves, costume jewelry, and trench coats of every color are just a few of the vintage selects you’ll find in this casual shop. Down the block, there’s sister shop Vini Vini Luxe, which focuses on higher end items. Address: Japan,〒150-0034 Tokyo, Shibuya City, Daikanyamacho, 12−19 第３横芝ビル 3F Half vintage, half contemporary, this shop stocks clothing with an edge (and in shades of black, gray, and white). Mainly focused on items designed for men, there are vintage pulls from Japanese designers like Comme des Garçons and Undercover, along with Dior Homme, Jil Sander, Prada, Miu Miu, and more. Address: Factory_01 B1F, 2-31-2 Jingumae, Shibuyaku, Tokyo 1500001 Part tailor, part vintage shop, this store’s offerings—yes, mostly dresses—are on display as if each piece is part of a museum exhibit. The benefit of the two-in-one is that each garment by designers like Yves Saint Laurent, Nina Ricci, and Louis Feraud has been carefully inspected before it goes up for sale, so no pesky pinholes or dropped hems remain. Another bonus is if it needs a little tailoring to become a perfect fit, the shop can help. Address: 22-4 Sarugakucho, Shibuya City, Tokyo More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

Mikey Madison Is the 2025 Awards Season’s Fashion Darling,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/mikey-madison-fashion-darling-anora,"February 21, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Mikey Madison is the talk of the town. The 25-year-old actor is the center of (deserved) awards buzz thanks to her ferocious performance in Anora as Ani, a Brighton Beach dancer and sex worker who impulsively marries Vanya (Mark Eydelshteyn), the young, foolhardy son of Russian oligarchs. While Madison—who people may also recognize from Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood, Scream, and Better Things—is a rising star in Hollywood, she’s also growing her profile in the fashion world. With help from stylist Jamie Mizrahi—who also works with the likes of Jennifer Lawrence, Adele, Riley Keogh, and Jeremy Allen White—the young actor has leveled up her style game. A Chanel darling during the Cannes Film Festival, Madison wore haute couture on the Croisette. (Consider it a good luck charm: Anora wound up taking home the Palme D’or.) Since then, she’s mastered movie star glamour in an open-back black velvet Prada dress embellished with scattered crystals, and a black drop-waist Rodarte with a tiered tulle skirt. But she’s also used her press tour to prove she isn’t afraid of taking risks, like when she wore a sexy Saint Laurent suit or a Chanel tweed short suit. Saving the best for last, she wore the Schiaparelli spring 2024 finale look (as worn on the runway by Kendall Jenner): a curve-hugging midi dress covered in red faux fingernails to the New York premiere. Madison kicked off the race to the Oscars in a red custom Prada, and dabbled in haute couture in a black Schiaparelli skirt and bra set at the Gotham Awards. For the 2025 Golden Globes, the first of the major awards shows, she wore one of Matthieu Blazy’s last custom Bottega Veneta dress: a gold scaly strapless number. Since then, she’s continued a hot-streak of custom looks, usually in black, white, or red (with some occasional gold, for good measure). Still, even with a lean color palette, the looks are never anything short of thrilling, from her backless red Simone Rocha dress to the drapey Proenza Schouler with surprise hip cutouts. This is just the start of Mikey Madison as a fashion force. Follow along throughout awards season to keep up with her rising star. In Prada at the Universal Focus Features DWA BAFTA celebration. In custom Prada at the BAFTAs. In Chanel at the Charles Finch & Chanel Pre-BAFTA Party. In Proenza Schouler at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. Wearing The Row at the DGA Awards.

Bella Hadid Folds Vintage Dolce & Gabbana Into Her Cowgirl Wardrobe,https://www.vogue.com/article/bella-hadid-vintage-dolce-and-gabbana-cowgirl-wardrobe,"February 21, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Bella Hadid will never run out of ways to incorporate cowboy boots into an outfit. Last night, the model celebrated her new collaboration with Frankie’s Bikinis at Stella West Hollywood, where she added some cowgirl flair to her look. Hadid wore a black long-sleeve tee and matching black button-up micro shorts. In something of an update to the 2000s Juicy Couture tracksuit, both her shirt and shorts were emblazoned with “Lucky” in red cursive across her chest and backside. Adding to the look was was a pair of sepia lensed pilot sunglasses from Chanel’s fall 2024 collection. But still a cowgirl through and through, Hadid managed to bring a Western element with a pair of four-and-a-half-inch heeled boots from Dolce & Gabbana featuring a butterfly motif across the toe and shaft. The boots hail from the brand’s now-defunct offshoot label D&G geared toward a younger demographic, likely their spring 2004 collection. Hadid always manages to nod to the rodeo with her outfits, whether she’s rocking a pair of chaps, or offering more subtle tributes with fringed suede bags and Western belt buckles. While her towering Dolce & Gabbana boots definitely aren’t suitable for horseback riding or cutting competitions, Bella Hadid will always find a way to honor her inner cowgirl. Yeehaw!

Though she has no shortage of high-octane looks—ranging from glamorous full-length coats paired with jeans to skintight LBDs—the Fenty founder chose to match with her partner, A$AP Rocky, in coordinating Saint Laurent suiting looks. For her birthday dinner, Rih wore a brown double-breasted blazer with peak lapels and structured shoulders, a white button-up, and slim black trousers. She added a feminine touch to the menswear-inspired outfit with a black leather shoulder bag, extreme pointy-toe pumps, and a berry lip. But two of Rihanna’s accessories were a perfect match with Rocky’s: a burgundy necktie with thin diagonal stripes and a pair of chunky black Ray-Bans. (The glasses were no accident. Today, Rocky was announced as the first-ever creative director for Ray-Bans, with their first collaboration expected in spring.) Rocky stuck to his usual suiting for the occasion. He also opted for a double-breasted blazer—his in gray—over a white button-up and a pair of black trousers. But he chose to add an additional layer, wearing a light khaki gabardine trench coat over his suiting. The rapper has gained attention for his Saint Laurent-heavy suiting as of late. Earlier this week, Rocky was found not guilty in a felony assault trial. During the nearly month-long proceedings, his court style consisted of impeccably tailored suiting—much like what he wore to Rihanna’s birthday dinner. Now, with his recent not guilty verdict, he reminds us that his suiting was not just for show, but rather is consistent with his wardrobe year-round. While suiting isn’t exactly what first comes to mind for couple style, Rihanna and A$AP Rocky are making a very strong case for doubling up on menswear. Plus, they can help each other tie their ties!

Gen Z Deserves an Hervé Léger Bandage Dress Revival,https://www.vogue.com/article/gen-z-herve-leger-bandage-dress-revival,"February 21, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"When Kaia Gerber attended the Toronto International Film Festival premiere of her film Shell, she sought out a designer who isn’t as common on the red carpet nowadays: Hervé Léger. The model wore a white full-length bandage dress, a recreation of her mother Cindy Crawford’s 1993 Oscars look. “Kaia had sent me a mood board for TIFF and this was one of her references,” Molly Dickson, who styled Gerber for the event, told Vogue. While Gerber was paying homage to her supermodel mom, it did give the label a moment in the sun for a new generation. Even for the eldest Gen Z-ers, the French brand’s trademark bodycon silhouette felt out of reach, falling out of fashion before we reached an appropriate age to wear them. “Hervé Léger is the ’90s supermodel second-skin,” Liana Satenstein, host of Neverworns and former Vogue writer says of the dress’s appeal. And, as she wrote in 2022, “an Hervé bandage dress acts as a bra for your whole body—holding you perfectly in place.” Rihanna at the 2007 Clive Davis Pre-Grammys Party. Blake Lively as Serena van der Woodsen on Gossip Girl, 2009. The dress persisted beyond the ’90s supermodel era, reaching the early days of Kardashian fame, teen soap operas, and Transformer movies. As my Millennial colleagues regale the Gen Z staffers with tales about hitting the club in a form-fitting Hervé Léger number, I can’t help but feel a pang of FOMO. But beyond Gerber, it seems that the younger generation is bandage dress-curious. On TikTok, young people who missed the boat last time around are creating a new wave of interest. One video with over 116,000 likes reads, “pov: your [sic] born in 2001 but now your [sic] old enough to own a herve leger dress.” Another proclaimed she was “feeling soooo serena van der woodsen,” referring to a dress that Blake Lively wore on Gossip Girl. With a cycle of nostalgia-driven trends, it’s no surprise that the bandage dress would reincarnate. “Today, there is an overwhelming sensual mood in the air and a thirst for going out,” Satenstein says. During a recent live shopping installment of Neverworns, she included a rainbow gradient dress with white piping by Léger, which she says “felt right for the world.” It was purchased before the evening was over. My colleague Margaux Anbouba, Vogue’s senior beauty and wellness editor, told me of her bandage dress days, “Hervé Léger saw me through some of my brightest and boldest moments of the aughts. At the time, I don’t think I had ever felt more powerful than when I put on a bandage dress—the sucked in sausage casing effect was perfect for my favorite pastime of that era, dancing in the club.” May the members of Gen Z get to experience that same joy that only a bandage dress can provide.

"It’s Time to Update Your Trench Coat, Per Stars Like Rihanna and Hailey Bieber",https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/modern-trench-coats-celebrity-winter-trend,"February 20, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. It’s currently peak coat season, and celebrities are slipping into their best statement outerwear to keep warm. What has been a hit amongst the A-list trendsetters recently? Elegant draped coats and plushy shearlings have been spotted on stars like Kendall Jenner and Ayo Edebiri. But for those in the less-frigid settings, a more lightweight coat has been taking off: Meet the modernized trench coat. At first glances these Rihanna and Hailey Bieber-approved coats may look like your average khaki trenches. But lean in a little closer to notice the details, and you’ll find a bevy of refreshing updates—be it the silhouette, the prints, or the fabrics—that give the trench coat a 2025-worthy feel. Leather trenches, whether in classic black or luxurious chocolate brown, have been one such way to make the wardrobe staple feel current. Rihanna paired hers with fitted snakeskin knee boots, while Anya Taylor-Joy wore a belted style with a chunky turtleneck sweater underneath. Gugu Mbatha-Raw also embraced a statement trench via a checkered Burberry version. If a lightweight cotton or twill treatment is more your speed, celebrities such as Mikey Madison and Monica Barbaro—two awards season darlings this year—have embraced the classic khaki trench in new shapes. With details like extra-slouchy fits or asymmetrical lapels, their reworked coats have just enough visual interest to make them feel new and exciting—without ever going out of style. But that’s the beauty of a trench, isn’t it? No matter if you go for a bold or subtle style, it will forever be a timeless hero piece that you can mix and matched. So, do like the stars and go for one that has some extra pizazz. As Nicki Minaj once said, “who wants to look simple when you could look stunning?” Below, see more modern approaches to the trench coat.

Kendall Jenner and Ayo Edebiri Inspired My Draped Outerwear Obsession,https://www.vogue.com/article/kendall-jenner-ayo-edebiri-draped-outerwear,"February 19, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"This past New York Fashion Week, you couldn’t walk five feet without seeing a draped scarf jacket. But the look is spanning well past the streets of Manhattan and the runways. Celebrities like Kendall Jenner and Ayo Edebiri are also embracing the effortless outerwear. Jenner has been a documented fan of the scarf jacket since late 2023, when she showed off her Phoebe Philo caped bomber in Los Angeles. Later that week, she wore a buttery leather Bottega Veneta trench coat, a matching scarf draped across her chest. Jenner’s fondness for the two-in-one look persisted, to the point where she was among NYFW’s many scarf jacket enthusiasts. After walking in the Calvin Klein Collection’s revival show, the model cloaked herself in a sage green top from The Row, adding some dynamism to her classic cropped white tee and trousers. Kendall Jenner leaving the Calvin Klein Collection fall 2025 show on Feb. 7. Edebiri modeled the look—also in The Row—at the premiere of her film Opus at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival. The actor wore a chartreuse midi dress with a matching coat that she draped over her elbow with a pair of ladylike ankle-strap heels. Ayo Edebiri at the 2025 Sundance Film Festivall, Jan. 27. It’s no surprise that the look is spiking in popularity this winter. The Toteme scarf jacket reached cult status in 2023. But with Calvin Klein, Kallmeyer, and Brandon Maxwell all showing the drapey silhouette on the runway this season‚ plus the endorsement from two high-octane dressers like Kendall Jenner and Ayo Edebiri—we can safely assume that the trend is just beginning.

I Need Celebrities to Stop Changing Clothes Every Five Seconds,https://www.vogue.com/article/i-need-celebrities-to-stop-changing-clothes-every-five-seconds,"February 14, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Last week, Anya Taylor-Joy spent the day running around New York City to promote her forthcoming film The Gorge. In one day alone, the actor wore five separate outfits—ranging from a sensational Alexander McQueen shearling coat to a mod Celine skirt suit and a brown leather Loewe trapeze jacket. Taylor-Joy is far from the only celebrity to change outfits at light speed: Keke Palmer, Blake Lively, and Sydney Sweeney have all recently churned out scores of looks in a short amount of time. Beyond street style, awards shows and red carpets have become an opportunity for outfit changes galore. At the Grammys, Doechii and Chappell Roan were among the artists to switch up their looks—Doechii in a parade of custom Thom Browne, Roan in a series of rodeo clown-inspired outfits. Recently, the speed at which celebrities change clothing seems to be reaching terminal velocity. Sure, there is a logic behind this phenomenon: they are usually in the throes of a press tour, taping junkets, talk shows, and social spots on a condensed timeline. Changing outfits offers the illusion that celebrities have more hours in the day than the rest of us, that they can fulfill endless professional obligations. Why, after all, would we want to know that an actor did GMA, a Buzzfeed puppy interview, and Hot Ones all in the same day? That would shatter the fantasy of promotional work as breezy and fun. Meanwhile, when it comes to awards shows, a roster of outfit changes can tell a story and convey power, something both Doechii and Chappell Roan executed at the Grammys. Both singers, nominated for Best New Artist, pulled off major fashion flexes in what the Recording Academy considers their freshman year: Roan changed from archival Jean Paul Gaultier couture into custom Thom Browne, while Doechii rocked four custom looks (also by Browne) over the course of the evening. But, be it street style or red carpet dressing, constantly changing outfits dilutes the power of the fashion. One can only imagine all of the time and effort that goes into making or procuring a garment—sourcing, shipping, tailoring—just for it to be worn for only a few minutes. It also causes red carpet moments to lose their salience. After all, who cares what a celebrity is wearing on the red carpet when we know they’re about to head inside and change? It’s not a problem contained to the fashion industry. We as a culture have a voracious appetite for newness, constant stimulation. But this ecosystem of nonstop changing is wildly unsustainable in terms of the environment, labor, and time. Going forward, celebrities and their stylists would be better served curating fashion moments that promote quality over quantity. After all, we only have so many hours in the day: why waste it changing every hour when one great look is all it takes?

New York Fashion Week Street Style Embraced a Ladylike Agenda—7 Outfits to Re-create,https://www.vogue.com/article/new-york-fashion-week-looks-fw25,"February 13, 2025",By Cortne Bonilla,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. The fall 2025 New York Fashion Week shows have officially ended, and the city-dwelling street style scene is always one to watch. I mean, who does New York better than New Yorkers? Amid what felt like an eternity of larger-than-life silhouettes, it seems a new sartorial tide has turned. While you’ll never not see oversized shapes and head-to-boot monochromatic looks, a demure and sophisticated approach dominated the streets of Manhattan and Brooklyn: ladylike dressing. Structured jackets (some collarless, some cinched at the waist) first arrived on the scene last spring, and now we’re seeing these feminine sensibilities influence other categories. Showgoers embraced the modern lady, taking cues from the past with long leather gloves peeking out from elegant outerwear or affixed onto belts, brooches pinned to jacket lapels, and an array of silk scarves to add a burst of color and lightweight warmth (it’s still winter!). For an easy transition into the new season, there are a plethora of ladylike goodies—and styling tips—to take from the NYFW scene. From fitted coats and classic blazers to leather gloves, skinny belts, and more, here are our favorite street style looks to re-create from the uptown-meets-downtown-meets-Brooklyn crowd. Just when you think New York couldn’t get any gloomier, an eruption of vivid color emerges onto the scene.

A Moment For the Cool Model-Off-Duty Looks From NYFW,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/best-model-off-duty-looks-nyfw-fall-2025,"February 11, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"The new fall 2025 collections, debuted during New York Fashion Week, were not the only exciting looks to take in this week. Off the catwalk, the street style scene put forward interesting new outfit propositions as well—be it via great coats, new It bags, or statement hosiery. And while this season’s crop of well-clad showgoers mostly consisted of celebrities, editors, and VIP influencers, the participating models—dashing from one show to the next—also delivered their own fashion flavor. This week’s shows served as a true hub for impeccable model-off-duty style, as there is something effortlessly cool about the way models put outfits together in between gigs. Sure, their own outfits often different drastically from the new designs they sport on the runway, but they sometimes strike similar notes of elegance and trendiness. Take model of the moment Alex Consani, who was spotted in an oversized cream sweater and slouchy leather boots, or runway regular Paloma Elsesser, who paired calf-length leggings with a cropped leather bomber. Other supermodels, like Kendall Jenner, opted for statement accessories to keep warm during the week—like a jaunty hat and scarf. While the looks were built for function and coziness while on-the-go—they were also perfect for the awaiting street style photographers crowing around pre-and-post show. This is NYFW, after all: one must be camera-ready at all times. In need of some winter style inspiration? Look no further than to the models who made the streets of New York their personal runway.

In Perfect Step: A Maison Margiela and Christian Louboutin Collaboration Inspired By One Magical Collection,https://www.vogue.com/article/in-perfect-step-a-maison-margiela-and-christian-louboutin-collaboration-inspired-by-one-magical-collection,"February 21, 2025",By Hamish Bowles,"Christian Louboutin first remembers John Galliano 40 years ago, making his first, tentative steps in Paris, the city of dreams, the city of fashion. “He was an excited English fashion student, but also very, very excited by Paris,” Louboutin recalls, “He was always saying, ‘I love Paris, and Paris loves me!’ And Paris really loved him.” John Galliano had rather despaired of his London life. The ’80s had been a glorious, carefree, wild decade, but those heady days were coming to an end. AIDS was rearing its terrible head, and heroin cast a pall. Fashion in London was tough. His backers withdrew their support. But Galliano knew that in Paris his fantasies would somehow become realities. There, he slept on friends’ sofas and ate beans on toast as he chased this elusive dream. Louboutin recalls that “he was a very joyful, happy person.” Galliano was swept up in the Paris world. And it treated him royally, for a time. But in spite of this love and their friendship, Louboutin and Galliano had never collaborated in a serious way before on a collection. Of course they had collaborated on individual models for specific clients (for instance, Louboutin did the shoes for Kate Moss’s 2011 wedding—the dress, a memorably 1930s fairy tale by John Galliano for Margiela). The Maison Margiela x Christian Louboutin collaboration. That is, until “one day I had lunch with John and Alexis [Roche, his partner], and he said, out of the blue, ‘Would you consider doing something with me?’ And immediately I said ‘Yes of course!’ John was very, very happy. And suddenly he was a shower of ideas. This was a milestone in his story because he was so, so, so, into it. He was drowned by it, and so excited and so precise, and so full of his creative energy.” Galliano “always loved shoes but he’s never made them,” as Louboutin explains, so he has assembled key figures who have brought their skills to the medium, “and I’m very happy and proud to be one of them,” adds Louboutin. “You know, it’s funny when you work. We worked almost a year ahead, and it was very complicated—because his clothes are incredibly complicated to do because of the faux cul [the false bottom] and so on. Everything was on a level of couture that is almost never reached.” Ultimately, the show was a triumph; a swansong for John Galliano’s extraordinary decade at Maison Margiela. “It was of a perfection,” says Louboutin, “that evening, with the drizzle under the bridge.” The show was held under the Pont Alexandre III bridge in Paris, where Galliano had conjured a sort of thread bare 1930s boite. It was a Brassai moment, with Pat McGrath’s extraordinary second skin, shining face masks. “Even if I was expecting something which was going to be great, I was not necessarily ready to have such a vision of such an impactful show. It’s one thing that you can expect from very, very few designers, and you can expect this from him,” says Louboutin. “The level of emotion involved in the show, not only in the clothes, but in the show itself: it was a really magical moment. You know, it's poetry and magic. Even just talking about it makes me emotional! It took 40 years of John Galliano to make me cry at a show,” remembers Louboutin. “…And the shoes!” So now, taking a deep breath after the show of shows, Louboutin has worked on a second collection for Maison Margiela, the silhouettes drawn from the show. They have outlined a few stores, “So they will be sold at Margiela and they will be sold at Louboutin!” he exults. “Ever since I've known John,” Louboutin continues, “he has a kind of passion for tribal clothes, [clothes] from plays, from dance, from Kabuki. His brain is built boiling around that anyway.” A look from the Maison Margiela spring 2024 couture—and Louboutin’s high heeled version of the Tabi. There are outrageous high heels, and foot-to-the-ground flats, all with the Tabi, the toe separator, off setting the glamour of the Louboutins. (Although it’s made in a whole new way, more couture and less homespun than the Margiela originals). There are also wedding shoes, with a twist. “The idea was almost like a game to play with the codes of two houses, Margiela and Louboutin. With Margiela you have deconstruction. I would call it ‘creative minimalism’ for Margiela. And for my DNA, it is almost a classical vision of femininity, a sexy femininity. So basically, for me to bring Margiela into my world."" So in a white high-heeled Tabi shoe with a streak of red paint down the heel, one can see the worlds of Margiela and Louboutin colliding. “I think it's probably the perfect marriage!” laughs Louboutin.

A Rare Ashley Olsen Sighting Provides a Lesson in Ultimate High-Low Dressing,https://www.vogue.com/article/ashley-olsen-high-low-dressing-nike-trainers-margaux-bag,"February 21, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Hark, the first glimpse of an Olsen in 2025! It’s Ashley Olsen, Olsening in a way only she and Mary-Kate can. (Despite the copycats and The Row flatterees.) Photographed out in New York City, The Row founder was seen running errands in a long-line black puffer jacket, a gnome-like black beanie (both she and her sister are fans of tall headgear), a checked scarf, and black track pants tucked into grey marl socks. On her feet, she wore Nike V2K Run Sneakers—a sporty, out-of-step footwear choice for Olsen, who often opts for a ballet flat or sleek Mary Jane from her own label, or a Birkenstock clog. On her arm, she toted her brand’s enduringly covetable Margaux bag—quite the contrast. But Ashley is a dab hand at high-low dressing and off-beat pairings: whether that’s a coat and flip-flop combo or twinning with her actual twin. While the stealth wealth emblem, the Margaux bag, has reached the upper echelons of desirability and virality, it’s also a pretty practical accessory for when you’re scooting about the city on a mission like Olsen. Then the Nike sneakers, with subtle detailing and a chunky, comfortable sole, makes more sense. Sneakers can be a tough pick—especially when your overall aesthetic leans more light and feminine. This week, Bella Hadid leaned into the ’80s Jane Fonda dance class aesthetic, pairing a tank top and polka dot bodycon shorts with distressed Coach sneakers. The Row’s Owen runner has become its own street style favorite over the years, and it doesn’t look like we’re getting over the Adidas Samba OG anytime soon, beloved by everyone from Emily Ratajkowski to Kendall Jenner. Puma’s Speedcats are picking up on the track, with Dua Lipa fronting its campaign. And if you so happened to be at Copenhagen Fashion Week, you’ll have spotted Cecilie Bahnsen’s romantic ASICS collabs on all the cool girls’ feet. (Be quick, a new, floral-studded drop is coming from Bahnsen x ASICS.) Both Olsen twins, too, are pros at dressing for the relentless cold: layering trenches and button-ups, expert layers, and knits. Even if a Margaux is a far-off dream, God knows we need Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen’s state of dressing pointers right now.

"As Peggy Flanagan Runs for Senate, a Look Back At Her Intentional Style",https://www.vogue.com/article/peggy-flanagan-election-trail-fashion,"February 20, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Earlier this morning, Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota Peggy Flanagan formally announced that she will be running to represent the state in the U.S. Senate. “A Native American woman has never won a seat in the U.S. Senate before,” Flanagan wrote on her Instagram page. “I believe we can change that. Are you with me?” Flanagan is seeking to replace Senator Tina Smith, who announced earlier this month that she would not seek re-election in 2026, opening up a seat for Minnesota. A Democrat who has served as Minnesota’s Lieutenant Governor since 2018, Flanagan was heavily involved in last year's Harris-Walz campaign. Throughout the race, her intentional fashion choices were impossible to miss. At the 2024 DNC, Flanagan wore a black and white Jamie Okuma Parfleche blazer and skirt, and a pair of Copper Canoe Woman statement earrings. Flanagan has chosen to spotlight contemporary Indigenous designers on the national stage (Flanagan is a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe). “I really want those earrings,” one viewer noted, while another simply exclaimed, “She is fabulous!” Wearing Jamie Okuma In the months that followed, as the presidential election race continued to accelerate, Flanagan only continued this intentional approach to dressing for the campaign trail. Whether speaking at rallies or canvassing for citizens to get out and vote, Flanagan has been using what she wears for a much deeper purpose—to draw attention to some of the nation’s finest Indigenous designers, and on a larger level, to draw awareness to the Indigenous community as a whole. (Especially in certain swing states, such as Arizona, where the Indigenous vote was crucial.) Wearing a traditional ribbon skirt It’s no secret that what politicians wear in the public domain is always strategic. Whereas Kamala Harris and Dr. Jill Biden have both embraced patriotic style—keeping to classic shades of red, white, and blue to demonstrate their love for their country—Flanagan has chosen colorful garments, including traditional ribbon skirts, as well as statement earrings (her signature piece) made of dentalium shells, beads, or turquoise; She has taken a distinctive approach that champions the unique beauty and craftwork found within her own Native community. The celebratory and upbeat feel of her ensembles is also fitting given that, if Flanagan is elected to the Senate, she would become the first Native American woman to win a seat; What she has worn, then, has nodded to this potentially historic moment. Flanagan's themed earrings Flanagan isn’t the only politician to take such a thoughtful approach to fashion, either. Throughout their times in office, Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland and Kansas Representative Sharice Davids have done so as well. For Haaland’s swearing-in ceremony back in 2021, she donned a vibrant traditional ribbon dress from Reecreations, moccasins, and dragonfly earrings made by the Laguna Pueblo metalsmith Pat Pruitt. For Flanagan, however, her joyful approach to style reflects how she is feeling in this very moment. “As the first Native American and woman of color elected statewide in Minnesota,” she wrote on Instagram, “I am overwhelmed with gratitude and hope.” This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

Bella Hadid Is Keeping the ’80s Alive,https://www.vogue.com/article/bella-hadid-is-keeping-the-80s-alive,"February 20, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Fashion may be obsessed with all things naughties at the moment, but Bella Hadid is all in on the 1980s. Yesterday in Los Angeles, the model left a photoshoot looking the picture of a jazzercise aficionado. She wore a sheer white tank top over a white bra and knee-length white shorts with black polka dots. The bodycon bottoms, from Miaou, were even affixed with a precious black bow. Rounding out her look was a pair of tall white socks scrunched around her calves and a pair of distressed Coach sneakers. Hadid opted for black accessories to complement the black micro polka dots in her shorts, trotting out her beloved Saint Laurent Y Bag and a pair of black sunglasses. While the look was plenty modern, we could easily imagine her starring in a series of exercise VHS tapes à la Jane Fonda, or appearing as a background actor in a remake of 1985’s Perfect. We feel confident that Bella Hadid could singlehandedly kickstart a jazzercise craze—or, at the very least, an ’80s-fashion moment.

Hailey Bieber Heralds the Return of This Divisive Shoe Trend,https://www.vogue.com/article/hailey-bieber-divisive-shoe-trend-peep-toe-heel,"February 20, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Hailey Bieber has returned to the West Coast after a mammoth stint away from home, packing away her enviable coat collection and sharp suiting that led her Aspen and New York wardrobes. For this Los Angeles homecoming and her latest Rhode pop-up, Bieber relied on some of her sartorial calling cards—adding a divisive vintage shoe trend. Bieber wore a fresh off the runway dress from the Ferragamo spring 2025 collection: an espresso brown leather mini-dress with sculptural details and a curved skirt, which she paired with a matching brown, croc leather pouch. On her feet, she wore strappy, laced sandals with an expansive peep-toe. The ’50s-era summer shoe is so back. The beauty founder stepped out party-ready at the launch of her latest product, the limited edition Sugar Cookie Peptide Lip Treatment. She posed with fans and friends at the pop-up, popping a sheer, chocolate brown tighted leg to show off the toe-exposing pumps. It was a chic way to wear the nostalgic—and much maligned—shoe silhouette. Following the event, Bieber was joined by her husband Justin—in his usual style of fits, comprising of baggy jeans, an even roomier leather jacket, and cap—and the pair were spotted heading for dinner at Funke with friends in Beverly Hills. Hailey added a faux fur coat. More ladylike shoe trends continue to emerge. Recent BAFTA winner Mikey Madison is a fan of Ferragamo’s patent t-bar sandal. The T-bar heel harks back to the ’40s and ’50s, a polite shoe silhouette worn often by Audrey Hepburn and repped also by everyone from Zoe Saldaña to Ariana Grande, in Jimmy Choo and Khaite respectively. The peep-toe’s comeback has been quiet yet assured, with some more modern updates: by way of Tory Burch’s sculpted peep-toe pumps with a crescent heel, Magda Butrym’s floral detail heels with a pearl just kissing the exposed toe, textured Alaïa slip-ons, and Dries Van Noten’s treble toe enveloping, piggie-baring mules. And with it still not being warm enough yet for bare legs and feet, a peep-toe paired with a sheer tight offers another teasing, sensual feeling layer a la Hailey Bieber.

27 of Rihanna’s Boldest Style Moments Throughout the Years,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/rihanna-style-statement-looks,"February 20, 2025",By Alice Cary,"As far as fashion is concerned, Rihanna has always been ahead of the curve—able to dabble in trends in a genuinely fearless manner. Risk-taking is central to her style influence, and what better time to revisit her epic wardrobe than today, on her 37th birthday? Off-duty, Rihanna is a true fashion girl. By day, she's in tracksuit-stiletto combos, gargantuan puffer jackets, and killer thigh-high boots. By night, she’s often wearing similarly casual gear, with the added touch of some vintage jewelry (or lots of diamonds) and a designer coat. Uniting her day-to-night dressing? A sense of fun and excitement: Don’t ever expect the star to wear discrete everyday basics. Rih’s red carpet looks command attention, too, though. In the noughties, she rocked low-rise trousers, crop tops, and plentiful diamanté. In 2015, she made headlines with a sunshine-yellow Guo Pei gown at the Met Gala, and her 2017 Comme des Garçons dress and 2018 John Galliano headpiece also broke the internet. More recently, she attended the Fashion Awards in London—with A$AP Rocky by her side—sporting a a Christian Lacroix fall 2002 couture mini dress with the matching oversized fuzzy hat, naturally. In honor of her birthday, revisit Rihanna’s most head-turning looks, below. Rih was one of the first out the gate in Saint Laurent’s fuzzy heart coat back in 2016, shown at the maison’s fall 2016 showcase. Many stars have braved the naked dress—Rihanna included. She commanded attention in a sparkling Swarovski crystal-encrusted look by Adam Selman at the CFDA Awards in 2014. Comme des Garçons was behind the eccentric look that she wore to the Met Gala in 2017. The vibrant gown that she wore to the Met Gala in 2015 will go down in history as one of the best looks the event has ever witnessed. Rihanna attended her Diamond Ball—a bash that she throws every year—wearing Alexis Mabille couture and Chopard jewels in 2018. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Saoirse Ronan Has Undergone a Style Shift for the Ages,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/saoirse-ronan-awards-season-style-2024,"February 19, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Earlier this year, Saoirse Ronan returned to the screen with a doubleheader: Steve McQueen’s World War II film Blitz, and her passion project, The Outrun, a drama about a woman just out of rehab. For her reentry into the public eye, Ronan tapped stylist Danielle Goldberg to help her meet the moment. Lo, Ronan’s rejuvenated sense of style has already set the internet ablaze, like when she was spotted wearing a vibrant teal JW Anderson dress—and fresh off the runway, no less. But, much like her prolific acting career, she’s no one-hit wonder. She’s turned heads in refined, yet unconventional looks, like her power-clashing moment in archival Phoebe Philo-era Celine from 2013 and the eggshell Khaite dress worn over trousers for a conversation with her Ladybird and Little Women costar Timothée Chalamet at BFI Southbank. But fashion fiends have been particularly thrilled with Goldberg styling the Oscar nominee in younger labels like newly minted LVMH Prize winner Hodakova, New York darling Colleen Allen, and ultra-cool sunglasses brand Thistles. We got an early taste of what we can expect from Ronan’s red carpet style at the 2024 Gotham Awards in New York City where the actor shot straight to best-dressed territory in an ankle-length Schiaparelli couture dress embellished with 3D thorns and complete with a rosette emerging from the neckline of her bustier. But she’s also gone the more classic route, like at the British Independent Film Awards, where she wore a sparkly dark blue caped dress—a custom Erdem. A regular collaborator with Nicolas Ghesquière, she turned to Louis Vuitton for the 2024 Emmys, where she wore a navy blue two-piece with a sheer draped panel, and again for the Academy Museum Gala where she opted for a black column dress with a sculptural off-the-shoulder top. The pair also kicked off the season on a high at the Governors Awards, where Ronan wore a light aqua Louis Vuitton column dress with a tactile bodice. Ghesquière also dressed the actor for the back-to-back IFTA and BAFTA Awards. For the former, Ronan wore a billowing strapless dress in that same beguiling blue as her JW Anderson mini; and at the BAFTAs, she wore a more subdued seafoam green scoop-neck with a matching stole. Follow along here as we celebrate Saoirse Ronan’s style throughout the 2024-2025 awards season.

Need Office Style Inspiration? Do Yourself a Favor and Watch Clockwatchers,https://www.vogue.com/article/clockwatchers-office-style-inspiration,"February 18, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"For those of us navigating the corporate world, getting dressed in a smart and professional look every day for work can be—well—a challenge. An endless calendar of deadlines and meetings means that you need a rotating wardrobe of smart shirts and sleek blazers to go with them. It can also be hard to have fun and add flavor into your work style, especially if you’re in a more traditional office setting. Investment banking in cool ripped jeans and a mesh JPG top? Unlikely. However. . . have you watched the underrated 1997 dark comedy Clockwatchers recently? If not, do it for the style inspiration alone: A recent re-watch of the workplace comedy has unearthed a goldmine of corporate style ideas worth taking notes on. If you have yet to see this often-overlooked film, let’s get the plot out of the way. Directed by Jill Sprecher and costume designed by Edi Giguere, the movie follows a group of Global Credit temporary employees as they navigate their unfulfilling day-to-day duties in the office. The real star of the show, though, is not the satiric script or the campy performances, but rather how each character brings their own unique approach to dressing for the corporate ladder. There’s Iris (Toni Collette), the new girl with a prim-and-proper sensibility, thanks to her buttoned-up cardigans and skirts; Margaret (Parker Posey), the edgy and jaded temp who stomps around in her cool chunky sweaters and grungy combat boots; Paula (Lisa Kudrow), an aspiring actor whose silky blouses and mini skirts lean into office siren territory; And Jane (Alanna Ubach), who dresses more ladylike in her classic shift dresses and statement jewelry. Talk about a star-studded cast—and their chic ensembles are just as noteworthy. Throughout the film, the four office friends slowly begin to descend into madness—the humdrum environment and corporate watchdogs causing them to grow more paranoid and unhappy by the day. But even as their polished facades come undone in the workplace, and their office goes dystopian and Orwellian real quick, their impeccable style persists. We first meet Paula, for instance, at the copy machine in a chic Gucci statement belt. Even near the end of the film, despite all of the grim happenings around them, her love for a good silky top and pristine blowout continues to steal all the scenes. The four characters each show how to bring personality to office looks. Margaret, for one, pairs a burgundy corduroy skirt suit with tights and chunky boots one day, and a teal V-neck sweater with a punky plaid skirt another; the perfect balances of dressy and cool. Paul and Jane each take turns wearing bold, bright-colored summer dresses that are a statement, yet still suitable for the boardroom. Watching the movie again has totally inspired me to rethink my approach to office dressing. The next time you’re doubting if your cool, trendy outfit is work-ready, just channel the Clockwatchers girls and remember: You can embrace fashion and individuality without being sent to Human Resources.

The print—whether horizontal or vertical, colorful or subdued—easily complements trending hues and patterns. For spring and summer, they tend to become the hero of the season, but this year another pattern is vying for your attention. Polka dots! Polka dot-printed clothing is about as classic as it gets, but we’ve seen a resurgence of the timeless pattern stamped onto new season silhouettes. It popped up during the spring/summer 2025 shows, making waves at Jacquemus and Acne Studios, and proved its staying power by re-emerging yet again on the fall/winter 2025 runways. Think of Altuzarra’s fall 2025 ready-to-wear collection, where dotted billowy coats, halterneck dresses, and knitwear were given a cool, laid-back kind of femininity. Brandon Maxwell showcased an artistic interpretation of the print with a brushed, drawn polka-dotted scarf coat. When it comes to styling your own polka-dot looks, you can never go wrong with traditional white and black. Jacquemus spring/summer 2025 For fresh color combinations, look to warm-weather-ready finds from Posse’s red-and-pink dotted sundress to Bode’s chocolate brown print. If you fancy the feminine—a flouncy tie-neck blouse and pleated skirt are ideal for the office, and a post-work date. If you’d prefer to go the casual route, wear a dotted button-up shirt with wide-leg linen trousers, then add a minimal sandal.

Keke Palmer Shakes Up a Classic White Shirtdress,https://www.vogue.com/article/keke-palmer-shakes-up-a-classic-white-shirtdress,"February 18, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Fashion can be a very serious business, but Keke Palmer—the bona fide comedian she is—knows that, sometimes, an outfit just needs a healthy dose of humor. Last night, at the 7th Annual American Black Film Festival Honors in Los Angeles, the actor brought some levity to a time-honored wardrobe staple: the white shirtdress. Styled by Zoe Costello, Palmer wore an off-the-shoulder Balmain number from Olivier Rousteing’s resort 2025 collection. Sexier than a de rigueur shirtdress, it featured a thigh-high slit and a cinched waist. Best of all, the trompe l’oeil number was complete with a stiff white collar—and a tag—over her décolletage, as if she was holding the dress in front of her. Palmer took the outfit in a different direction than the Balmain collection’s lookbook. She wore a pair of black pointy-toe pumps and added a gold bee brooch to the dress’s vestigial collar. Keke Palmer at the 7th Annual American Black Film Festival Honors. Balmain resort 2025. The actor has been all about bold fashion lately. On her recent press tour for her film One of Them Days, she broke out some serious vintage looks, including a cerulean John Galliano Dior dress from 2007, and a burnt orange Dolce & Gabbana from the same year. And that’s nothing to say of her contemporary looks. With some surreal Schiaparelli under her belt, it’s no wonder Keke Palmer embraced this funky Balmain shirtdress.

How To Get Rid Of Clothes Moths And Protect Your Wardrobe,https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-get-rid-of-clothes-moths,"February 18, 2025",By Ellie Pithers,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Moth-proofing your wardrobe is essential, if you don’t want the insects feeding on your most expensive cashmere knits and silk dresses. Clothes moths kill your investment pieces, and completely negates that big closet clean-out you did. While moth season tends to run from April to May, and then again from August to September, it’s become an issue throughout the U.S., thanks to rising temperatures. Not sure where to begin? Below, see Vogue’s top tips for preventing a moth infestation in your wardrobe—and how to tackle one if it’s already too late. Moths tend to be attracted to natural fibers like cashmere, silk, lambswool, shearling, and cotton because they feed on the protein keratin, the building block of these materials. Given that keratin also helps form human hair, skin, and nails, it’s crucial that you ensure your clothes are clean before you stow them away in your wardrobe. If you see a moth flying around your home, don’t fear. It’s not necessarily a clothes moth. The two main types that feed on your clothes in the United States—the webbing clothes moth (Tineola bisselliella) and the casemaking clothes moth (Tinea pellionella)—are small and difficult to see. The webbing clothes moth is identifiable from its golden color and around half an inch in length, while the casemaking clothes moth is pale, silvery gray-brown with dark spots, and fringed, hairy wings. Most people realize clothes moths have invaded their wardrobes when they see small holes in their knitwear or silk dresses. One option is to keep Pheromone super sticky glue traps, which attract the male moths, therefore removing them from the reproduction cycle, in your wardrobe or around your home. They also act as an indicator as to whether you have moths, or you can also use a moth box to monitor for a possible infestation. Moths eggs are tiny—usually between 0.5 to 1.5 millimeters in size—making them extremely difficult to see, but you might spot the webbing that larvae leave behind on your clothes. The life cycle of a moth is 65 to 90 days, with female moths laying up to 300 eggs each. This means your small moth problem can very quickly escalate. It’s the larvae that feast on natural fibers, not the adult moths which don’t actually have the ability to eat. Eggs will hatch after anything between four days and three weeks—in summer this process is faster than in winter. Yes—however it requires real commitment and dedication (and sometimes professional help) to get on top of an infestation. Once you have managed to do so, the key is to keep following the below steps to safeguard your wardrobe against clothes moths and prevent further infestations from happening again and again. Moths can enter your home through cracks, windows, and on new items of clothing, so just because you have got on top of your problem doesn’t mean they won’t return. Moths like undisturbed corners that are dark and warm. Remove everything from your wardrobe, vacuum all the corners and drawers, and wipe all your surfaces with a detergent-soaked cloth to kill off larvae. Then wash all of your clothes (and curtains and upholstery, too). Dry cleaning kills moth eggs and larvae, and is an excellent option for bulky items like coats. Freeze anything you can fit on your freezer shelves; sub-zero temperatures kill larvae, although make sure you put clothes in plastic bags prior to freezing to avoid a condensation build-up. Keep them in there for at least 48 hours, or up to a week if you can. Heat also kills larvae and eggs, however, hot temperatures can damage cashmere. To ensure you’ve got rid of all the larvae and eggs, Total Wardrobe Care’s Julia Dee explains that you can start by “applying natural moth-killing products, such as chrysanthemum-based sprays.” This will prevent any more moths hatching, so you don’t go back to square one. A moth infestation can cause thousands of pounds worth of damage depending on the clothes you have in your wardrobe, and so bringing in the professionals to fumigate your house if the problem is significant is often worth the investment. Moths love to feast on human sweat, food particles, and stains. Do not put any clothes back in your newly cleaned wardrobe that are dirty—especially knitwear or natural fibers. As well as laundering your clothes, ensure that your wardrobe and drawers are also clean. “Regularly wipe down surfaces with soapy water and thoroughly vacuum cracks and crevices to remove any larvae or eggs,” Dee recommends. Moths hate light and movement, so this can also help disturb them. Always store winter knits, coats, and any other items you particularly value in zipped garment bags (like knitwear and cashmere bags), and line the bags with anti-moth paper strips. Line your drawers in anti-moth paper, and deploy cedarwood blocks. Vintage clothes should always be dry cleaned or put in the freezer before being introduced to your wardrobe, as they are often the source of infestations. Moths hate them, and they’ll keep the shoulders on your dresses and jackets neat, too. Always take your clothes out of the plastic hanging bags from the dry cleaner. The plastic attracts dust, and the dust attracts moths. Keep checking your clothes for moth holes, keep rooms well-ventilated as temperatures start to rise, and keep a natural oil diffuser in your wardrobe at all times—it smells great and wards off moths. Moth cassettes are also a good precautionary measure, and you can keep them hanging on your rail at all times. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Rising Star David Jonsson Is More Than Ready For His Rat Pack Moment,https://www.vogue.com/article/david-jonsson-baftas-2025-rising-fashion-star,"February 17, 2025",By Kerry McDermott,"“I’m an introvert by nature,” David Jonsson tells Vogue, days before attending the 2025 BAFTAs, where he was in the running for the Rising Star prize (spoiler alert: he won!). While walking the red carpet doesn’t necessarily come naturally to the Rye Lane star, “it’s made 10 times easier when you look good,” he says with a smile. To that end, the 31-year-old has chosen a custom Gucci tux with a Swarovski embroidered vest and a satin bow tie for the biggest night in British film—which earned him a major milestone in his own career (previous Rising Star winners include Tom Hardy, John Boyega, Daniel Kaluuya and Tom Holland). “I remember the kids growing up in my area in east London, you know, people would go to desperate lengths to wear Gucci. It really feels special.” He’s accessorized with the help of “another dream brand,” Cartier, which supplied David’s rare Cloche de Cartier timepiece. “It’s in the shape of a D, funnily enough,” he says, listing watches as one of his guilty pleasures, along with cars and motorcycles. (“I sound like such a boy.”) “For me, part of fashion is functionality,” says Jonsson, who is currently preparing to play Sammy Davis Jr to Sydney Sweeney’s Kim Novak in Colman Domingo’s directorial debut, Scandalous. “You can use it to your favor: to exude confidence or exude sexiness or exude class, or whatever. If I don’t feel confident in something, I’d rather go nude!” Growing up, he says, that meant throwing on a graphic tee, or “whatever you feel good in,” but the actor increasingly finds himself drawn to tailoring. “I’ve been looking a lot at Sammy Davis Jr and the Rat Pack. Those men…They knew how to dress up.” Jonsson no doubt has plenty of awards ceremonies in his future, and he’s learning to embrace the process of getting ready for a red carpet. “I learn a lot from actors that I adore, and I remember Cillian Murphy saying, you’d be an [idiot] not to enjoy these moments,” he says. “I love the rituals of getting ready… a nice shower, and I’m a big fan of scents as well. Those are the moments I like taking some time over. When you get to wear stuff like what I’m wearing to the BAFTAs, you should take your time, you know?

Dakota Johnson Puts Her Own Twist on the Safety Pin Dress With a Sexy Slit,https://www.vogue.com/article/dakota-johnson-dress-slit-snl50,"February 17, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"It’s been a while since we’ve had a show-stopping dress slit. Purveyors of the classic and sexy red carpet look range from Angelina Jolie to Miley Cyrus—another lover of the leggy affair? Dakota Johnson. And this time, the actor went from thigh-high to hip-kissing. Johnson stepped out on the red carpet for Saturday Night Live’s 50th anniversary special at 30 Rockerfeller Center on Sunday evening (February 16)—a starry event celebrating the pop culture behemoth, with attendees including Vogue cover star Sabrina Carpenter, Kim Kardashian, Miley Cyrus, Emma Stone, and Bad Bunny. The Madame Web actor wore a black, one-sleeved Gucci gown fastened with delicate gold hardware and a bodysuit underneath, allowing the brave slit to travel up to her hips. She also wore black open-toed stilettos and minimal jewelry, with a sweep of eyebrow-skimming bangs and her brunette hair long and straight. The delicate gold chains holding Johnson’s Gucci dress together recalled another sensual and daring red carpet look: the safety pin dress, which through the years, has been worn by Anne Hathaway, Miley Cyrus, Kristen Stewart, and of course the vivacious original, Elizabeth Hurley in Versace. Johnson’s own interpretation is stoically sensual. It was a stylish weekend of events celebrating Saturday Night Live’ 50th year, that ran the gamut of true Hollywood glam and campy looks. Emma Stone filled her custom Louis Vuitton gown pockets with popcorn and toted a cinema snack box in lieu of a bag, while Miley Cyrus donned two Roberto Cavalli looks—one recent runway, one archival—for a gothic showgirl performance. For her own stage-time to do the ever-iconic “D*ck in a Box” song, Lady Gaga wore a black velvet gown with a zany-patterned gift box attached to her waist. Glamor, intrigue, sex—a stellar sartorial tribute to SNL. Johnson is no stranger to skin-forward gowns, and it’s usually Gucci that’s her go-to: sheer, silvered, shimmering. But what Dakota Johnson surely proves here is that sometimes, your legs are your best accessory. Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

Emma Stone Takes the ‘Popcorn Actress’ Label Literally,https://www.vogue.com/article/emma-stone-popcorn-dress-snl-50,"February 17, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"One of those best things about going out to see a show? The theater snacks. Maybe a box of nachos or a little cup of ice-cream to see you through the evening—but Emma Stone is all about the popcorn. And she made sure she had enough to hand at SNL50: The Anniversary Special in New York City, by wearing her own cinema snacks on her hips. The actor stepped onto the red carpet with partner and former SNL writer Dave McCary sporting a custom Louis Vuitton, cinema seat red, halterneck dress. The dress had two pockets that were heaping with popcorn. The rest of Stone’s look was simple: Louis Vuitton red heels, gold star-shaped earrings, and in lieu of a bag, a candy-striped popcorn box filled with more popcorn that she of course helped herself to. Stone wore her hair in her latest pixie cut. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. It was also a special sort of date night for Stone and McCary ,who first met in 2016, when Stone, who hosted SNL in December that same year, starred in a sketch directed by McCary, “Wells for Boys.” Stone is also one of only a few five-time SNL hosts (and remains the youngest to have ever done so) including Steve Martin and Tom Hanks. It’s also not the first time popcorn has been part of the 2025 entertainment industry chatter. Rewind, to Demi Moore’s speech at the 2025 Golden Globes ,when she won best actress for The Substance. It marked the first major industry award in the 62-year-old actor’s 45-year career, and in her moving acceptance speech, she acknowledged the stereotypes she has faced for having starred in films primed for entertainment value and box-office earnings over critical reception or contributions to cinema discourse—defying the ‘popcorn actress’ label. And as the weekend of SNL celebrations continued and we reflected on the mammoth show’s impact on pop culture, the moniker feels even more foolish. Stone’s snackable style was by longtime stylist Petra Flannery, whose other client Zoe Saldaña took home best supporting actress for Emilia Perez at the BAFTAs on the same evening. Less campy than Stone but still big on the drama, Zoe Saldaña wore a pleated collar Yves Saint Laurent gown. We could maybe just about get away with likening Stone’s popcorn-filled pockets to the structured hips and peplum silhouetted gowns that are more in keeping with her usual red carpet style: like her eggshell colored 2024 Oscars gown, or her red shelf-hipped 2025 Golden Globes dress—both also by Louis Vuitton. Popcorn pockets or whimsy peplums, Stone tends to lean into classic Hollywood glamor and elegant gowns. Her last red carpet surprise was all about her newly done pixie cut—which she’s likely cut for Bugonia, her latest film with Yorgos Lanthimos and which is set to debut in 2025. Stone’s SNL50 dress went down well with fellow attendees—Seth Rogan even got a couple of handfuls. Feeling peckish? Emma Stone’s got you. But one question that remains: was it sweet or salted, buttered or toffee? More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Blake Lively Brings Her Love of Florals to SNL’s 50th Anniversary Special,https://www.vogue.com/article/blake-lively-saturday-night-live-florals-red-carpet,"February 16, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Tonight, the Saturday Night Live 50th Anniversary Special airs on NBC—celebrating five decades of the hit sketch comedy show, with a slew of celebrity guest cameos. The red carpet premiere in New York City was extremely star studded: Kim Kardashian, Bad Bunny, Meryl Streep, Anya Taylor-Joy, and more all hit the step and repeat. One high-profile duo in the mix? Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, who attended the occasion in their finest formal attire. Lively opted for her signature red carpet look for the night: a glitzy floral-covered dress. (Fans of the star will recall she wore floral designs nonstop throughout her It Ends With Us press tour, as a nod to her character in the film, who is a florist.) Lively’s latest SNL look consisted of a silver Tamara Ralph sequin-covered gown, complete with floral embellishments throughout. For a more monochromatic finish, she accessorized with diamonds and strappy metallic hells. Reynolds, meanwhile, wore a classic black tuxedo, white dress shirt, and a bowtie. Tonight marked one of Lively’s first major public appearances since reports of a legal battle between her and her It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni emerged—a dispute which remains ongoing.

Inside the Stylish Weekend Celebrating Saturday Night Live’s 50th Anniversary,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/saturday-night-live-50th-anniversary-red-carpet,"February 16, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Saturday Night Live is marking a major milestone: This weekend, the iconic sketch comedy show from creator Lorne Michaels is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a slew of events in New York City. The festivities kicked off on Friday evening, with the SNL50: The Homecoming Concert at Radio City Music Hall. Naturally, the red carpet was a star-studded affair. Given SNL has welcomed hundreds of A-list hosts and musical guests over the years (it’s hard to think of a big star who hasn’t made a cameo on the show), it was only fitting that many celebrities joined the fun. Among those who walked the step and repeat on Friday were Miley Cyrus, Chris Pine, Christine Baranski—each one of them bringing some good, old-fashioned glitz and glamour to the party. Inside the historic venue, Lady Gaga performed “Shallow” with Andy Samberg, and did a funny bit to botch the song, before performing “Dick in a Box”—their 2009 SNL parody banger. Gaga, in a velvet black dress, stood with a zany giftbox taped to her waist—three guesses as to what they’re insinuating is inside. Miley Cyrus took to the stage in her gothic showgirl glory to perform “Flowers”, do a cover of Queen’s “Crazy Little Thing Called Love” with Brittany Howard, and shout that she loves Paul Rudd. Cher also performed “If I Could Turn Back Time,” well as Bad Bunny, Post Malone, The Backstreet Boys, The B-52’s, and Will Ferrell and Ana Gasteyer (who did their own hilarious versions of songs like Doechii’s “Denial is a River.” The celebrations continued on Sunday night, with the official SNL50: The Anniversary Special airing on NBC. Another step and repeat premiere was held for the release—and even more celebrities came out for the viewing party. Below, see all of the stars at SNL’s 50th-anniversary kickoff and how things went down inside. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

The Best Dressed Stars From the 2025 BAFTAs,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/best-dressed-stars-2025-baftas-red-carpet,"February 16, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"This evening in London, the 2025 BAFTAs marked the latest celebration of some of the last year’s best film and television projects—among them Wicked, Emilia Pérez, Anora, and Conclave. As such, the red carpet saw a bevy of A-list stars turn out for the affair (many of whom are also nominated for Academy Awards in March). The best dressed stars of the night? Those who leaned into New Hollywood glamour (yes, you read that right), choosing sculptural silhouettes and modernized finishes that felt fresh. Take Wicked star Cynthia Erivo, who went ethereal in her white macramé cotton lace bustier gown (with a breastplate that defied gravity—get it?). In McQueen, Demi Moore also turned heads in a dazzling gown that was reminiscent of stained glass, while Emilia Pérez star Selena Gomez chose a long, sleeveless gown by Schiaparelli Couture embroidered with silver sequins, crystals, rhinestones, and tassels—talk about disco ball dressing at its finest. As for some of the best dressed gents of the night? Colman Domingo reworked traditional suiting in a printed shirt and leather coat by Versace. Timothée Chalamet went sleek in all black Bottega Veneta—a refreshing switch-up from the bolder, more Y2K-leaning looks he has been wearing while promoting A Complete Unknown. (And isn’t that the making of a true fashion star—keeping us on our toes?) Below, see the best dressed stars from the 2025 BAFTAs. Is this your favorite look? Is this your favorite look?

Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner Do Matching Couple Style at the BAFTAs,https://www.vogue.com/article/timothee-chalamet-kylie-jenner-couple-style-baftas-2025,"February 16, 2025",By Olivia Allen,"With the 2025 BAFTAs in full swing, Timothée Chalamet has once again got us talking. Fresh off the A Complete Unknown press tour–zipping around on a Lime bike in Martine Rose and fully leaning into his Bob Dylan era—his latest look continues the streak. Over the weekend, he made waves at the Berlin Film Festival, out in Kendrick-inspired bootcut jeans and accompanying Kylie Jenner in a pink Chrome Hearts tracksuit—a stark contrast against his girlfriend’s glittering gown. For tonight’s red carpet, though, Timmy went for something a bit more classic. The best-actor nominee wore a double-breasted, all-black ensemble by Bottega Veneta—proving that sometimes simplicity really is best. It was a departure from his laidback athleisure looks this week, but felt like exactly the right choice for his moment in the limelight. While Jenner skipped the step and repeat (as she did at the Golden Globes and in Berlin), the beauty mogul was spotted inside the ceremony wearing a black embellished slip dress—perfectly matching Timothée’s sleek red carpet look.

Cynthia Erivo’s Louis Vuitton Breastplate Defies Gravity at the 2025 BAFTAs,https://www.vogue.com/article/cynthia-erivo-louis-vuitton-dress-baftas-2025,"February 16, 2025",By Olivia Allen,"Cynthia Erivo knows how to make an entrance, and she did just that at the 2025 BAFTAs tonight. In a white lace-embroidered Louis Vuitton gown, the Wicked star delivered a sculptural look that solidified her reputation for bold, red-carpet winning fashion. With its sharp architectural design, the dress was a statement that held space (get it?) from head to toe. While Erivo delivered a series of Elphaba-green looks during the Wicked press tour, the British actor has shifted towards a more monochrome colour palette during awards season—from the black-and-white floral gown she wore at the Golden Globes (also by Louis Vuitton) to the black sequined Armani Privè gown she wore at the Critics Choice Awards. Nominated for Best Actress at this year’s BAFTAs, Erivo’s transition from Broadway to film has been the stuff of legends—with three Oscars nominations under her belt, she’s solidified her place among Hollywood’s elite. As she gears up to co-host Vogue’s Fashion & Film party, it’s clear that Erivo is an unstoppable force both on screen and off. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Ayo Edebiri Wore New York Fashion Week’s Rising Star for SNL 50,https://www.vogue.com/article/ayo-edebiri-snl-colleen-allen-new-york-fashion-week-rising-star,"February 18, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"It’s no secret that Ayo Edebiri quickly ascended to one of Hollywood’s best dressers in almost no time. While the actor has courted brands from Loewe to Prada, she’s always down to push the envelope with more avant-garde labels—with a helping hand from her stylist, Danielle Goldberg. Now, she’s the first to wear a brand-new piece from one of New York Fashion Week’s fast-rising stars, Colleen Allen. Edebiri was among the dozens of stars who participated in SNL’s 50th anniversary special over the weekend. The actor, who hosted the show in February 20204 returned to the hallowed halls of 30 Rock, joining Robert DeNiro, Drew Barrymore, Jimmy Fallon, and Rachel Dratch in a reprisal of “Debbie Downer.” Ayo Edebiri Colleen Allen fall 2025, look 2. The sketch was a black-tie affair, and Edebiri tapped Allen for the occasion, choosing a piece from the designer’s fall 2025 collection: a floor-length black velvet dress featuring a plunging, smocked neckline, which Edebiri styled with a black Sophie Buhai choker with a silver pendant. The dress debuted at NYFW just last week in an appointment-only presentation that my colleague José Criales-Unzueta described as “New York’s hottest club.” While Ayo Edebiri may not have been among the fashion editors who oohed and ahhed over Allen’s sumptuous velvets and rich color palette in person, she reminded us at SNL that she’s always got her finger on the pulse.

How To Get Rid Of Clothes Moths And Protect Your Wardrobe,https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-get-rid-of-clothes-moths,"February 18, 2025",By Ellie Pithers,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Moth-proofing your wardrobe is essential, if you don’t want the insects feeding on your most expensive cashmere knits and silk dresses. Clothes moths kill your investment pieces, and completely negates that big closet clean-out you did. While moth season tends to run from April to May, and then again from August to September, it’s become an issue throughout the U.S., thanks to rising temperatures. Not sure where to begin? Below, see Vogue’s top tips for preventing a moth infestation in your wardrobe—and how to tackle one if it’s already too late. Moths tend to be attracted to natural fibers like cashmere, silk, lambswool, shearling, and cotton because they feed on the protein keratin, the building block of these materials. Given that keratin also helps form human hair, skin, and nails, it’s crucial that you ensure your clothes are clean before you stow them away in your wardrobe. If you see a moth flying around your home, don’t fear. It’s not necessarily a clothes moth. The two main types that feed on your clothes in the United States—the webbing clothes moth (Tineola bisselliella) and the casemaking clothes moth (Tinea pellionella)—are small and difficult to see. The webbing clothes moth is identifiable from its golden color and around half an inch in length, while the casemaking clothes moth is pale, silvery gray-brown with dark spots, and fringed, hairy wings. Most people realize clothes moths have invaded their wardrobes when they see small holes in their knitwear or silk dresses. One option is to keep Pheromone super sticky glue traps, which attract the male moths, therefore removing them from the reproduction cycle, in your wardrobe or around your home. They also act as an indicator as to whether you have moths, or you can also use a moth box to monitor for a possible infestation. Moths eggs are tiny—usually between 0.5 to 1.5 millimeters in size—making them extremely difficult to see, but you might spot the webbing that larvae leave behind on your clothes. The life cycle of a moth is 65 to 90 days, with female moths laying up to 300 eggs each. This means your small moth problem can very quickly escalate. It’s the larvae that feast on natural fibers, not the adult moths which don’t actually have the ability to eat. Eggs will hatch after anything between four days and three weeks—in summer this process is faster than in winter. Yes—however it requires real commitment and dedication (and sometimes professional help) to get on top of an infestation. Once you have managed to do so, the key is to keep following the below steps to safeguard your wardrobe against clothes moths and prevent further infestations from happening again and again. Moths can enter your home through cracks, windows, and on new items of clothing, so just because you have got on top of your problem doesn’t mean they won’t return. Moths like undisturbed corners that are dark and warm. Remove everything from your wardrobe, vacuum all the corners and drawers, and wipe all your surfaces with a detergent-soaked cloth to kill off larvae. Then wash all of your clothes (and curtains and upholstery, too). Dry cleaning kills moth eggs and larvae, and is an excellent option for bulky items like coats. Freeze anything you can fit on your freezer shelves; sub-zero temperatures kill larvae, although make sure you put clothes in plastic bags prior to freezing to avoid a condensation build-up. Keep them in there for at least 48 hours, or up to a week if you can. Heat also kills larvae and eggs, however, hot temperatures can damage cashmere. To ensure you’ve got rid of all the larvae and eggs, Total Wardrobe Care’s Julia Dee explains that you can start by “applying natural moth-killing products, such as chrysanthemum-based sprays.” This will prevent any more moths hatching, so you don’t go back to square one. A moth infestation can cause thousands of pounds worth of damage depending on the clothes you have in your wardrobe, and so bringing in the professionals to fumigate your house if the problem is significant is often worth the investment. Moths love to feast on human sweat, food particles, and stains. Do not put any clothes back in your newly cleaned wardrobe that are dirty—especially knitwear or natural fibers. As well as laundering your clothes, ensure that your wardrobe and drawers are also clean. “Regularly wipe down surfaces with soapy water and thoroughly vacuum cracks and crevices to remove any larvae or eggs,” Dee recommends. Moths hate light and movement, so this can also help disturb them. Always store winter knits, coats, and any other items you particularly value in zipped garment bags (like knitwear and cashmere bags), and line the bags with anti-moth paper strips. Line your drawers in anti-moth paper, and deploy cedarwood blocks. Vintage clothes should always be dry cleaned or put in the freezer before being introduced to your wardrobe, as they are often the source of infestations. Moths hate them, and they’ll keep the shoulders on your dresses and jackets neat, too. Always take your clothes out of the plastic hanging bags from the dry cleaner. The plastic attracts dust, and the dust attracts moths. Keep checking your clothes for moth holes, keep rooms well-ventilated as temperatures start to rise, and keep a natural oil diffuser in your wardrobe at all times—it smells great and wards off moths. Moth cassettes are also a good precautionary measure, and you can keep them hanging on your rail at all times. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

The White Lotus Season 3 Fashion Is All About Loud Luxury,https://www.vogue.com/article/the-white-lotus-season-3-fashion-is-all-about-loud-luxury,"February 17, 2025",By Fawnia Soo Hoo,"Set on the picturesque island of Koh Samui, the third season of The White Lotus delivers plenty of immersive vacation porn as well as enviably audacious designer wardrobes on a new slate of badly behaving guests. “We don’t do quiet luxury,” says returning costume designer Alex Bovaird, who received two out of her three Emmy nominations for the first two seasons of the Mike White series. As a fresh set of potential Blossom Circle members take in the stunning views from the private boat to the resort, Raleigh, North Carolina, matriarch Victoria Ratliff (Parker Posey), tightly clutching her Gucci 1947 bamboo top-handle bag, turns down her nose at fellow guests—and the entire Thailand experience. With a bright blue silk scarf by Swaine London primly tied over the shoulders of her preppy Banana Republic shirtdress, Victoria wishes she was in England—or anywhere in western Europe—with her three children and sketchy financier husband Timothy (Jason Isaacs). “My inspiration for [the Ratliffs] was as if they just stepped out of a Ralph Lauren catalog,” says Bovaird. But Victoria did pack a suitcase, presumably checked first-class, of “loud Lilly Pulitzer”–esque dresses and floaty cover-ups, perfect for sipping mint juleps by a members-only pool. Bovaird referenced how the society set in Oxford, Mississippi, dress and the lifestyle of “the caftan queen of Birmingham, Alabama,” Susan Dumas. “She and her country club friends love vintage caftans,” says Bovaird, who also designed a resort-ready White Lotus–inspired collaboration with H&M. The eldest Ratliff sibling, Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger), thirsty for his withholding father’s approval, immediately telegraphs douchebag bro in one of his many Southern Tide polo shirts, wraparound Roger Federer sunglasses, and Gucci loafers sans socks. “His shorts are Brooks Brothers, and they’re just not the cool length,” says Bovaird. Younger sister Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook), who’s seeking spirituality on the island, hints at the burgeoning disconnect from her family with her ’80s-referential Ralph Lauren white lace dress. “She is a little bit more of the pure voice who’s looking for something more meaningful than her very materialistic family,” says Bovaird, who referenced a teenage Brooke Shields for Piper’s demure embroidered and lace-trimmed dresses. “[She’s] a bit more earthy, really wholesome, and a little more covered up.” Off to the side, a trio of 40-something childhood best friends giggle and gossip at the start of their decadent, and potentially debauched, reunion trip. In their coordinating sundresses, bags, and blonde highlights, they could be a girl group: TV actor Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan) in Alemais and Valentino; Austin socialite Kate (Leslie Bibb) in Paul Smith and Delvaux; and New York City lawyer Laurie (Carrie Coon) in Zimmermann and Loewe—check, check, and check. “They’re supposed to look interchangeable, but Laurie is the one who’s maybe trying to keep up with the girls,” says Bovaird. For the first-night dinner, Laurie dons a vintage Sue Wong watercolor-print jumpsuit, and later cries into her Giambattista Valli chain-link bag. Meanwhile, Kate, in red ruffle-tiered Lanvin, and Jaclyn, in a gold dragon-embroidered ’70s black vintage dress, trade fake, backhanded compliments. Jaclyn also employs her holiday as an opportunity for designer spon-con. “We imagined that she got a box of resort pieces that Valentino sent over. Maybe Kate grabbed a suit out of Jaclyn’s box,” says Bovaird. “Because that’s true to life—brands want to support actors.” For their first trip to the pool, Kate wraps a black-and-white panther-print sarong from the 2023 Escape collection around the waist of a Valentino hot pink maillot. Jaclyn, who’s regularly recognized by guests, appropriately called dibs on the showier, logo-mania pieces, like an oversized shirt cover-up and a flashy silver-sequined minidress. But odd couple Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood) and older boyfriend Rick (Walton Goggins) don’t quite fit in with the designer label–stacked façade of their fellow guests. “You’re supposed to bump up against them and think, Who are these two grifters? Because they are a little bit less put-together,” says Bovaird. “They seem like a couple of rogues. You’re just supposed to wonder what their story is, and they’re supposed to have a crackling sexual chemistry.” A grizzled Rick broods and smolders in a steady rotation of slouchy, halfway unbuttoned Hawaiian shirts, giving off the aura of an American expat with a questionable livelihood but deep pockets. Free-spirited Mancunian Chelsea takes selfies in a cutout My Beachy Side minidress. “She has this louche, sexy, Brigitte Bardot [vibe],” says Bovaird. “She’s been traveling for several years. We imagined she got the crochet dress from a market, or she collected things from Goa. She’s supposed to have this very market-driven, eclectic wardrobe.” Chelsea effortlessly mixes vintage with market-bought sarongs and minidresses, but her colorful bikinis are mostly by Corsica-based Tara Matthews. Chelsea also pairs a parrot-print vintage-looking Loewe wrap skirt with a throwback Blondie T-shirt, and carries JW Anderson and Louis Vuitton bags. “She has lots of sunglasses that she ‘got down at the market,’ but are actually by Jacquemus,” says Bovaird. Jacquemus also custom-designed two full looks for model Chloe (Charlotte LeBon), who a lonely Chelsea meets at the resort bar. (Keep an eye on Chloe’s “LBH”—“losers back home”—boyfriend, Gary, played by Jon Gries, who can’t seem to resist the nearest White Lotus location.) “[Jacquemus] designed special pieces just for The White Lotus in Thailand and hand-delivered them to Koh Samui,” says Bovaird about Chloe’s black-and-white polka-dotted bodysuit and striped, sequined skirt outfit that Chelsea admires, and a pink one-piece and sheer sarong for a yacht party. The White Lotus Maui spa manager Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) threads all three seasons of the slow-burn series together, as she spends a month at the Koh Samui outpost for a work-share session. She enjoys hands-on massage sessions with her very fit Thai counterpart, Pornchai (Dom Hetrakul)—and a resort wardrobe filled with colorful, tropical-print dresses and caftans from brands like Anthropologie and Verandah. “Belinda is a little self-conscious that she’s there on her work trip,” says Bovaird, who also custom-made looks with vibrant Thai fabrics for the character. “When she’s out of her uniform, she wants to feel as good as the guests.” Speaking of, what was it like putting Lalisa Manoban, aka Lisa of Blackpink, in a uniform to play resort staffer Mook? “I think it was refreshing for her not to worry too much about the bits and baubles, and making sure everything was super-fashionable,” says Bovaird. With the help of a local Thai crew, and input from Manoban, Bovaird custom-designed Mook’s blouse-and-sarong uniform. But the staffer first greets the guests in a cute palm-tree-and-monkey-embroidered short-sleeve shirt-and-shorts set that’s by Tombolo. “This season, we definitely upped our game,” says Bovaird. “We definitely had the right shoe for the right swimsuits, cover-ups, hats, bags, and sunglasses. Whereas, in season one, we were like, ‘Here are your flip-flops.’” Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

Dakota Johnson Puts Her Own Twist on the Safety Pin Dress With a Sexy Slit,https://www.vogue.com/article/dakota-johnson-dress-slit-snl50,"February 17, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"It’s been a while since we’ve had a show-stopping dress slit. Purveyors of the classic and sexy red carpet look range from Angelina Jolie to Miley Cyrus—another lover of the leggy affair? Dakota Johnson. And this time, the actor went from thigh-high to hip-kissing. Johnson stepped out on the red carpet for Saturday Night Live’s 50th anniversary special at 30 Rockerfeller Center on Sunday evening (February 16)—a starry event celebrating the pop culture behemoth, with attendees including Vogue cover star Sabrina Carpenter, Kim Kardashian, Miley Cyrus, Emma Stone, and Bad Bunny. The Madame Web actor wore a black, one-sleeved Gucci gown fastened with delicate gold hardware and a bodysuit underneath, allowing the brave slit to travel up to her hips. She also wore black open-toed stilettos and minimal jewelry, with a sweep of eyebrow-skimming bangs and her brunette hair long and straight. The delicate gold chains holding Johnson’s Gucci dress together recalled another sensual and daring red carpet look: the safety pin dress, which through the years, has been worn by Anne Hathaway, Miley Cyrus, Kristen Stewart, and of course the vivacious original, Elizabeth Hurley in Versace. Johnson’s own interpretation is stoically sensual. It was a stylish weekend of events celebrating Saturday Night Live’ 50th year, that ran the gamut of true Hollywood glam and campy looks. Emma Stone filled her custom Louis Vuitton gown pockets with popcorn and toted a cinema snack box in lieu of a bag, while Miley Cyrus donned two Roberto Cavalli looks—one recent runway, one archival—for a gothic showgirl performance. For her own stage-time to do the ever-iconic “D*ck in a Box” song, Lady Gaga wore a black velvet gown with a zany-patterned gift box attached to her waist. Glamor, intrigue, sex—a stellar sartorial tribute to SNL. Johnson is no stranger to skin-forward gowns, and it’s usually Gucci that’s her go-to: sheer, silvered, shimmering. But what Dakota Johnson surely proves here is that sometimes, your legs are your best accessory. Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

Emma Stone Takes the ‘Popcorn Actress’ Label Literally,https://www.vogue.com/article/emma-stone-popcorn-dress-snl-50,"February 17, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"One of those best things about going out to see a show? The theater snacks. Maybe a box of nachos or a little cup of ice-cream to see you through the evening—but Emma Stone is all about the popcorn. And she made sure she had enough to hand at SNL50: The Anniversary Special in New York City, by wearing her own cinema snacks on her hips. The actor stepped onto the red carpet with partner and former SNL writer Dave McCary sporting a custom Louis Vuitton, cinema seat red, halterneck dress. The dress had two pockets that were heaping with popcorn. The rest of Stone’s look was simple: Louis Vuitton red heels, gold star-shaped earrings, and in lieu of a bag, a candy-striped popcorn box filled with more popcorn that she of course helped herself to. Stone wore her hair in her latest pixie cut. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. It was also a special sort of date night for Stone and McCary ,who first met in 2016, when Stone, who hosted SNL in December that same year, starred in a sketch directed by McCary, “Wells for Boys.” Stone is also one of only a few five-time SNL hosts (and remains the youngest to have ever done so) including Steve Martin and Tom Hanks. It’s also not the first time popcorn has been part of the 2025 entertainment industry chatter. Rewind, to Demi Moore’s speech at the 2025 Golden Globes ,when she won best actress for The Substance. It marked the first major industry award in the 62-year-old actor’s 45-year career, and in her moving acceptance speech, she acknowledged the stereotypes she has faced for having starred in films primed for entertainment value and box-office earnings over critical reception or contributions to cinema discourse—defying the ‘popcorn actress’ label. And as the weekend of SNL celebrations continued and we reflected on the mammoth show’s impact on pop culture, the moniker feels even more foolish. Stone’s snackable style was by longtime stylist Petra Flannery, whose other client Zoe Saldaña took home best supporting actress for Emilia Perez at the BAFTAs on the same evening. Less campy than Stone but still big on the drama, Zoe Saldaña wore a pleated collar Yves Saint Laurent gown. We could maybe just about get away with likening Stone’s popcorn-filled pockets to the structured hips and peplum silhouetted gowns that are more in keeping with her usual red carpet style: like her eggshell colored 2024 Oscars gown, or her red shelf-hipped 2025 Golden Globes dress—both also by Louis Vuitton. Popcorn pockets or whimsy peplums, Stone tends to lean into classic Hollywood glamor and elegant gowns. Her last red carpet surprise was all about her newly done pixie cut—which she’s likely cut for Bugonia, her latest film with Yorgos Lanthimos and which is set to debut in 2025. Stone’s SNL50 dress went down well with fellow attendees—Seth Rogan even got a couple of handfuls. Feeling peckish? Emma Stone’s got you. But one question that remains: was it sweet or salted, buttered or toffee? More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Blake Lively Brings Her Love of Florals to SNL’s 50th Anniversary Special,https://www.vogue.com/article/blake-lively-saturday-night-live-florals-red-carpet,"February 16, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Tonight, the Saturday Night Live 50th Anniversary Special airs on NBC—celebrating five decades of the hit sketch comedy show, with a slew of celebrity guest cameos. The red carpet premiere in New York City was extremely star studded: Kim Kardashian, Bad Bunny, Meryl Streep, Anya Taylor-Joy, and more all hit the step and repeat. One high-profile duo in the mix? Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, who attended the occasion in their finest formal attire. Lively opted for her signature red carpet look for the night: a glitzy floral-covered dress. (Fans of the star will recall she wore floral designs nonstop throughout her It Ends With Us press tour, as a nod to her character in the film, who is a florist.) Lively’s latest SNL look consisted of a silver Tamara Ralph sequin-covered gown, complete with floral embellishments throughout. For a more monochromatic finish, she accessorized with diamonds and strappy metallic hells. Reynolds, meanwhile, wore a classic black tuxedo, white dress shirt, and a bowtie. Tonight marked one of Lively’s first major public appearances since reports of a legal battle between her and her It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni emerged—a dispute which remains ongoing.

Inside the Stylish Weekend Celebrating Saturday Night Live’s 50th Anniversary,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/saturday-night-live-50th-anniversary-red-carpet,"February 16, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Saturday Night Live is marking a major milestone: This weekend, the iconic sketch comedy show from creator Lorne Michaels is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a slew of events in New York City. The festivities kicked off on Friday evening, with the SNL50: The Homecoming Concert at Radio City Music Hall. Naturally, the red carpet was a star-studded affair. Given SNL has welcomed hundreds of A-list hosts and musical guests over the years (it’s hard to think of a big star who hasn’t made a cameo on the show), it was only fitting that many celebrities joined the fun. Among those who walked the step and repeat on Friday were Miley Cyrus, Chris Pine, Christine Baranski—each one of them bringing some good, old-fashioned glitz and glamour to the party. Inside the historic venue, Lady Gaga performed “Shallow” with Andy Samberg, and did a funny bit to botch the song, before performing “Dick in a Box”—their 2009 SNL parody banger. Gaga, in a velvet black dress, stood with a zany giftbox taped to her waist—three guesses as to what they’re insinuating is inside. Miley Cyrus took to the stage in her gothic showgirl glory to perform “Flowers”, do a cover of Queen’s “Crazy Little Thing Called Love” with Brittany Howard, and shout that she loves Paul Rudd. Cher also performed “If I Could Turn Back Time,” well as Bad Bunny, Post Malone, The Backstreet Boys, The B-52’s, and Will Ferrell and Ana Gasteyer (who did their own hilarious versions of songs like Doechii’s “Denial is a River.” The celebrations continued on Sunday night, with the official SNL50: The Anniversary Special airing on NBC. Another step and repeat premiere was held for the release—and even more celebrities came out for the viewing party. Below, see all of the stars at SNL’s 50th-anniversary kickoff and how things went down inside. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

The Best Dressed Stars From the 2025 BAFTAs,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/best-dressed-stars-2025-baftas-red-carpet,"February 16, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"This evening in London, the 2025 BAFTAs marked the latest celebration of some of the last year’s best film and television projects—among them Wicked, Emilia Pérez, Anora, and Conclave. As such, the red carpet saw a bevy of A-list stars turn out for the affair (many of whom are also nominated for Academy Awards in March). The best dressed stars of the night? Those who leaned into New Hollywood glamour (yes, you read that right), choosing sculptural silhouettes and modernized finishes that felt fresh. Take Wicked star Cynthia Erivo, who went ethereal in her white macramé cotton lace bustier gown (with a breastplate that defied gravity—get it?). In McQueen, Demi Moore also turned heads in a dazzling gown that was reminiscent of stained glass, while Emilia Pérez star Selena Gomez chose a long, sleeveless gown by Schiaparelli Couture embroidered with silver sequins, crystals, rhinestones, and tassels—talk about disco ball dressing at its finest. As for some of the best dressed gents of the night? Colman Domingo reworked traditional suiting in a printed shirt and leather coat by Versace. Timothée Chalamet went sleek in all black Bottega Veneta—a refreshing switch-up from the bolder, more Y2K-leaning looks he has been wearing while promoting A Complete Unknown. (And isn’t that the making of a true fashion star—keeping us on our toes?) Below, see the best dressed stars from the 2025 BAFTAs. Is this your favorite look? Is this your favorite look?

Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner Do Matching Couple Style at the BAFTAs,https://www.vogue.com/article/timothee-chalamet-kylie-jenner-couple-style-baftas-2025,"February 16, 2025",By Olivia Allen,"With the 2025 BAFTAs in full swing, Timothée Chalamet has once again got us talking. Fresh off the A Complete Unknown press tour–zipping around on a Lime bike in Martine Rose and fully leaning into his Bob Dylan era—his latest look continues the streak. Over the weekend, he made waves at the Berlin Film Festival, out in Kendrick-inspired bootcut jeans and accompanying Kylie Jenner in a pink Chrome Hearts tracksuit—a stark contrast against his girlfriend’s glittering gown. For tonight’s red carpet, though, Timmy went for something a bit more classic. The best-actor nominee wore a double-breasted, all-black ensemble by Bottega Veneta—proving that sometimes simplicity really is best. It was a departure from his laidback athleisure looks this week, but felt like exactly the right choice for his moment in the limelight. While Jenner skipped the step and repeat (as she did at the Golden Globes and in Berlin), the beauty mogul was spotted inside the ceremony wearing a black embellished slip dress—perfectly matching Timothée’s sleek red carpet look.

Cynthia Erivo’s Louis Vuitton Breastplate Defies Gravity at the 2025 BAFTAs,https://www.vogue.com/article/cynthia-erivo-louis-vuitton-dress-baftas-2025,"February 16, 2025",By Olivia Allen,"Cynthia Erivo knows how to make an entrance, and she did just that at the 2025 BAFTAs tonight. In a white lace-embroidered Louis Vuitton gown, the Wicked star delivered a sculptural look that solidified her reputation for bold, red-carpet winning fashion. With its sharp architectural design, the dress was a statement that held space (get it?) from head to toe. While Erivo delivered a series of Elphaba-green looks during the Wicked press tour, the British actor has shifted towards a more monochrome colour palette during awards season—from the black-and-white floral gown she wore at the Golden Globes (also by Louis Vuitton) to the black sequined Armani Privè gown she wore at the Critics Choice Awards. Nominated for Best Actress at this year’s BAFTAs, Erivo’s transition from Broadway to film has been the stuff of legends—with three Oscars nominations under her belt, she’s solidified her place among Hollywood’s elite. As she gears up to co-host Vogue’s Fashion & Film party, it’s clear that Erivo is an unstoppable force both on screen and off. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Why Demi Moore’s Custom McQueen Gown at the 2025 BAFTAs Was a Perfect Choice,https://www.vogue.com/article/demi-moore-baftas-2025-alexander-mcqueen-dress,"February 16, 2025",By Kerry McDermott,"Creative director Seán McGirr recently told British Vogue that he wants his Alexander McQueen to be about youthful energy and “the animal within.” Which makes the Irish designer’s work a particularly apposite choice for Demi Moore, star of The Substance, in which a younger version of her character, Elisabeth Sparkle, literally bursts forth from her flesh in scenes gorier than any wildlife documentary. Moore, who is in the running for the Leading Actress BAFTA for her performance in the film, arrived at the 2025 ceremony tonight wearing a glittering halter-neck gown, featuring a graphic design. Evidently a fan of McGirr’s work, the star previously wore a shimmering black gown from his spring 2025 Alexander McQueen collection on the red carpet back in November. Demi has emerged as the toast of awards season, having already scooped a Golden Globe last month, her first major win (indeed her first nomination, as she noted in her acceptance speech) in some 45 years in the movie business. An emotional Moore, who described how she’d gotten used to being written off as a “popcorn actress” despite having one of the most enduring careers in Hollywood, told the crowd on the night that she was celebrating “being reminded that I do belong.” If she’s had to wait a while for recognition from her peers, Demi, who collected that Golden Globe in a shimmering strapless Armani Privé gown, has never been short of fashion plaudits. While she was crafting her own looks for her earliest red carpet appearances, at 62 she’s a regular on the front row (frequently accompanied by her almost equally feted pet dog, Pilaf), and she’s been known to appear on the runway, too. When Kim Jones was preparing to unveil his debut Fendi Haute Couture collection at the Palais Brongniart back in 2021, he cast supermodels Kate Moss, Christy Turlington and Naomi Campbell, but it was Demi he tasked with opening the show.

Mikey Madison’s Custom Prada Gown at the 2025 BAFTAs Confirms She’s Fashion’s Newest Star,https://www.vogue.com/article/mikey-madison-2025-baftas-prada-dress,"February 16, 2025",By Emily Chan,"Since emerging on the scene in breakout hit Anora, Mikey Madison has quickly established herself as a fashion girlie—from the vintage lace Dior gown that she and stylist Jamie Mizrahi picked out for the British Independent Film Awards, to the gold sequined Bottega Veneta gown that she wore to the Golden Globes, which came with the added clout of being creative director Matthieu Blazy’s last custom look for the brand. As is often a rite of passage for a buzzy emerging actor, Madison seems to have found a particular affinity, though, with Miuccia Prada’s creations: see the custom red off-shoulder gown that she wore to the Governors Awards, the crystal-embellished black velvet dress she sported at the London Film Festival, or the blush-pink old Hollywood style Miu Miu gown she opted for at the Palm Springs Film Festival. It’s perhaps no surprise, then, that Madison went for another custom Prada look at tonight’s BAFTAs: a white bustier dress with an embellished crystal scarf that delivered old-school Hollywood glamour, firmly establishing her role as one of fashion’s (and Hollywood’s) brightest new stars. It’s a busy night for Madison, who is not only up for Best Leading Actress at tonight’s awards ceremony, but also co-hosting British Vogue & GQ’s Fashion & Film Party.

It’s a fun one this year, too, with the likes of Demi Moore, Cynthia Erivo, and Mikey Madison nominated for Best Actress (the latter two also happen to be co-hosts for British Vogue & GQ’s Fashion & Film after-party), while Timothée Chalamet is nominated alongside Adrien Brody and Hugh Grant in the Best Actor race. Not only that, but pop-songstresses-turned-Hollywood-stars Selena Gomez and Ariana Grande are both up for Best Supporting Actress, while Succession co-stars Jeremy Strong and Kieran Culkin have received nods in the Best Supporting Actor category. Meanwhile, Irish hip-hop trio Kneecap has picked up nominations in six categories, including Outstanding British Film category, alongside queer crime thriller Love Lies Bleeding.

Looking For A Bespoke Suit in Palm Springs? At Paul Marlow You Have Come To The Right Place,https://www.vogue.com/article/paul-marlow-palm-springs,"February 15, 2025",By Mark Holgate,"Just when you think you've heard every life-after-Covid story, you hear yet one more—and this one has a very happy outcome. Paul Marlow, formerly of the design collective Loden Dager, a witty and clever menswear label known for riffing on classic Americana as much as it did achingly hip contemporary New York, is now opening a store in Palm Springs to showcase his decade and counting bespoke tailoring business. Though store seems a little prosaic. At the risk of sounding pretentious (me, I mean, not Marlow) experiential space is better. As well as his impeccable made to measure suiting, and his NYC-manufactured off the rack shirting, and the sweaters knitted in Scotland, there is vintage furniture, new textiles, Voutsa wallpaper, tabletop, candles, fragrance and last but by no means least a revolving roster of art shows, all presented in a vast industrial building sandwiched between two interior design studios. What Marlow has created is an environment that’s as cool as the summer midday Palm Springs sun is hot; that is, extremely. Marlow wants this space to feel curated but not to leave you feeling overstimulated; less, to his thinking, is more. Photo: Courtesy of Paul Marlow “It really feels like a great materialization of my life in an external format, what with the art, the interiors, the textiles, and the custom clothing,” Marlow says. “After Loden Dager closed, I turned to doing bespoke, to make a fresh start. And then I started doing ready to wear again during Covid when nobody wanted to come in and get measured. That’s when I picked up on the idea of opening a store. My friends have had their store on this strip for 20 years and they're downsizing, so they rented me one of their spaces—so it comes with a great community, a great family of people.” The idea of a store wasn’t exactly untested for him, though. Marlow still has his tailoring atelier in the former Loden Dager design studio on West 29th Street in New York, where people can drop by and hang out as much as they can be fitted for something to wear. In fact, with its industrial NYC workspace vibe personalized by Marlow’s extensive art and book collections, as well as his elegantly lived-in vintage furniture, his Manhattan space was a kind of aesthetic forerunner for what he has done in Palm Springs. Paul Marlow in his Palm Springs store. This tale of two cities is professional but also personal. Marlow ended up in Palm Springs because he and his partner, the theater director Joe Mantello, had gotten a place there, retreating to it during the pandemic; they liked the life, they liked the community, and they liked, says Marlow “that it's one of the few places left in America where you don't get frowned on for being gay.” With Mantello wanting to spend more time there, Marlow started making plans for his Palm Springs store. Except, he says, laughing, “Joe doesn't want to go back to New York unless he's working on a project, and now he has like five plays in the pipeline, so he'll be in New York a lot. And now that I have the store I will mostly be here.” Marlow is certainly going to be kept busy. There is, he says, a ready market for what he is doing. “There's this built-in clientele of an educated design customer who is looking for something special to wear,” he says. “The population here has been growing ever since Covid. It’s not like we will have people coming in who are looking for a Palm Springs t-shirt.” Though truth be told, a tee like that might look pretty great under one of his classic but never stuffy jackets. If his post fashion label life has taught him anything, he says, it’s that working with his clients (who now number well into the hundreds) it’s that design is, “a continual collaboration. It has actually changed the way I designed and the way I approach things,” he says. “I used to be designing a collection with one body type in mind; now I'm fitting one garment on one body at a time. And so I've learned so much more about tailoring and how to fit and accommodate people's desires while making them look good and feel good. And if you don't feel good in something, you shouldn't wear it. It makes me so happy to see people’s posture changes when they put something on that I've made.” Immersing himself in a different life experience from New York, and to be in a world of the outdoors and mid-century/modernist design has, he says, imbued his clothing, “with a cleaner, simpler take on things; the less embellishment, the longer things last. I don't follow trends. I'm really keeping it very less is more.” The backdrop for all of this is no less considered. “I really like the juxtaposition of a gritty down and dirty workspace,” Marlow says, “but with these moments of perfection and allowing for the imperfections to also be perfect.” The fitting room, with vintage kilim rugs, and art by British painter Lucien Rees Roberts. Photo: Courtesy of Paul Marlow Accompanying the clothing is plywood furniture of his own design, which he is looking to sell at some point, as well as vintage pieces: a 1940s French coffee table; Michel Boyer stools; a Studio Italia lamp, and, an original Eames Bikini chair. “Things will,” he says, “be cycling through. And Joe has an amazing eye; he has been grabbing stuff for me.” Adding to the feel of the space is the art. The first showing will be of British artist Lucien Rees Roberts (“He hasn’t had a show in ten years”), with shows coming up from Jack Ceglic, Leanne Shapton, and Gus Van Sant. (He and Marlow are friends and they play that most Palm Springs of sports together—golf). Yet the intention of all this is the same: to create a world that’s considered and thoughtful but also casual and easy. It’s most definitely not about the hard sell. “I'm really taking my time,” Marlow says. “And there's not a ton of product in the store right now, but that's intentional. I don't want to rush things. Too much can be too distracting.” PAUL MARLOW, 68929 Perez Road, Cathedral City, Palm Springs, CA 92234. Open Thu-Sun 12pm-4pm and by appointment More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

Miley Cyrus’s Gothic Showgirl Fits Deserve Their Flowers,https://www.vogue.com/article/miley-cyrus-saturday-night-life-50-anniversary-outfits,"February 15, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Lady Gaga! Cher! Lauryn Hill! Snoop Dogg! Miley Cyrus! All the stars comprised a megawatt line-up of performances for yesterday evening’s celebrations for Saturday Night Live’s 50th anniversary. But it was Miley Cyrus’s showgirl looks with a very Miley Cyrus-y twist that snatched our hearts. The evening at the historic Radio City Music Hall in New York kicked off a weekend of festivities for show creator Lorne Michael’s cultural institution SNL. Ayo Edebiri, Anya Taylor-Joy, Amy Poehler, Jenna Ortega, Emily Ratajkowski, Chris Pine, Christine Baranski, Pete Davidson, and many others stepped out for the evening—the crowd was glitzy and very glam. Cyrus was among those performing, bringing her powerhouse vocals and trademark breezy, assured attitude. She sang her Grammy award-winning hit “Flowers” and gave playful shout out to all her buddies in the crowd: “I love you Paul Rudd!” Cyrus exclaimed. The camera panned to Rudd blowing a kiss. “Are y’all doing that Grammys thing where you guys are famous and shit and you don’t sing along…Excuse my language?” Anya Taylor-Joy and Pedro Pascal put that to bed, shown enthusiastically singing and dancing along. Cyrus also performed a cover of Queen’s “Crazy Little Thing Called Love” with Brittany Howard. The musician first took to the red carpet, wearing an all-black Roberto Cavalli gown. The leather dress had layers of winged cut-outs and a floatier tulle train that extended into a mermaid tail. It’s from the Italian house’s spring summer 2025 collection by Fausto Puglisi, and which Eva Herzigova wore on the runway. Cyrus styled it with Paris Texas lace-up black stilettos, and kept her brown and blonde highlighted hair tousled. She walked the carpet with mother Tish Cyrus and boyfriend Maxx Morando. Later for her performance, Cyrus once again opted for close-fitting, cut-out dominant Cavalli—but this time, it was an archive piece from the brand’s spring summer 2004 collection. The black dress fit close to her form, with diamond cut-outs and a feathered, sparkling skirt that gave her the showgirl dynamism necessary on stage. She commanded the show, with every shimmy, vocal swoop, and feather shake. Cyrus worked with her go-to regular stylist, Bradley Kenneth, for the affair. Kenneth has been dressing Cyrus in a succession of sultry, monochrome gowns by way of custom Yves Saint Laurent and Alaïa, Celine and Schiaparelli. Elsewhere across the evening, Gaga performed “Shallow” with Andy Samberg, and did a funny bit to botch the song, before performing “Dick in a Box”—their 2009 SNL parody banger. Gaga, in a velvet black dress, stood with a zany giftbox taped to her waist—three guesses as to what they’re insinuating is inside. Cher also performed “If I Could Turn Back Time,” well as Bad Bunny, Post Malone, The Backstreet Boys, The B-52’s, and Will Ferrell and Ana Gasteyer (who did their own hilarious versions of songs like Doechii’s “Denial is a River.” A fantastical evening, built around Cyrus’s super special performances and gothic showgirl wonder outfits—flowers for Miley!

Saoirse Ronan’s Latest Look Proves the Color Analysis Trend Works,https://www.vogue.com/article/saoirse-ronan-blue-louis-vuitton-dress-iftas,"February 15, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Saoirse Ronan’s style shift has been awe-inducing. Working with stylist Danielle Goldberg—a collaborator of filmic fashion girls Ayo Edebiri and Greta Lee too—Ronan has developed an elegant and understated, yet subversive set of sartorial codes. Think J.W Anderson asymmetric mini-dresses and archival Phoebe Philo-era Celine, pops of color and texture, and incorporating new-gen designers like Hodakova and Colleen Allen into the wardrobe. The actor’s latest outing adds to a thrilling stylistic oeuvre—and proves both she and Goldberg know the colors that work best for her. The Irish Film & Television Academy Awards took place in Dublin on Friday (February 14), celebrating the year in Irish film and television. Some of Ireland’s biggest names turned out for the ceremony, including Ronan, Cillian Murphy, Andrew Scott, Ruth Negga, Nicola Coughlan, and Sharon Horgan. For the occasion, Goldberg dressed The Outrun actor in custom Louis Vuitton by Nicolas Ghesquière. She wore the bold blue strapless gown with an empire waist and single pleat and kept to minimal accessories, with a set of Completedworks black drop earrings. Her hair was in a middle parting and tight bun, by Irish hairstylist Aidan Darcy, with a rose pink lip and a sweep of eyeliner by Vivien Pomeroy. Ronan is most certainly aware of what suits her on the color wheel. The royal blue shade and other hues of bright and more muted blue have cropped up in her wardrobe before: a J.W Anderson mini-dress, a silken navy Ferragamo shirt, and a puffball sleeve and skirted Louis Vuitton dress. A more electric shade of blue was even the color of her hair in her film The Outrun. Saoirse Ronan was one of the IFTA night’s most major names, winning two awards: Best Lead Actress for The Outrun, and Best Supporting Actress for Blitz. Proving blue is a winner’s color, will we see the shade carry her through to the weekend’s BAFTAs? More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Lisa Elevates Method Dressing for ‘The White Lotus’ in a Way Only She Can,https://www.vogue.com/article/lisa-white-lotus-dress-method-dressing,"February 15, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Check-in time! The White Lotus’s third season is imminent, and Lisa isn’t here to play. Method dressing has been a longstanding red carpet theme, that kicked off with Margot Robbie’s Barbie campaign and slalomed Wicked’s Ariana (Glinda) Grande and Timothée Chalamet’s Bob Dylan cosplay. But we can confidently say Lisa has brought the trend to full bloom. Set in a glam resort in Thailand, the third season of Mike White’s hit show will premiere this Sunday (February 16), and stars the likes of Lisa, Parker Posey, Leslie Bibb, Natasha Rothwell, and Carrie Coon. The cast swapped the loose and light holiday gear for their most elegant formalwear at the Los Angeles premiere, and jetted back out to Thailand for another glamorous affair. Lisa, adored for her Blackpink oeuvre and her own solo musical material (stream Alter Ego), is now a first-time actor. She’s been making the most of the promo run with an elegant array of looks. Last night (February 14), she attended the premiere afterparty at the Four Seasons Hotel Bangkok at Chao Phraya River, dressed as an actual lotus flower. The striking look consisted of a strapless, pale yellow mini-dress with a silver sash and crystal off-the-shoulder details. Posing expertly on the red carpet, her dress blended in with the backdrop’s unfurling lotus flower to create a striking look. Of course, Lisa knows how to work the stage to fulfil the fantasy. She finished the look with delicate gold sandals, and a watch that looked like a corsage. She kept her enviable bangs long and her hair in a loose updo. For the Los Angeles premiere, Lisa wore the similarly soft, pale yellow tone. She wore a regal Miss Sohee Couture gown that featured a fitted, sheer pearl-studded bodice with princessy cap sleeves that flowed into a silk-chiffon skirt with layers. The skirt had crystal top layers that overlapped like a flower petals. In her hand, she carried a single white lotus. Both looks seem to make a subtle and understated reference to the yellow American lotus flower. Her second look at the Thailand affair was a bright fuchsia set: a strapless cropped top with an attached bolero and a fitted skirt with a flowing taffeta train, and matching pumps. It was somewhat of an update on Marilyn Monroe’s Gentleman Prefer Blondes look—but most interestingly, it’s in the hue of Thailand’s own lotus flower strain. The flower is a symbol of purity, faithfulness, and spiritual awakening in Thailand, coming from The Red Lotus Sea, known in Thai as Talee Bua Daeng. Lisa plays Mook, a health-guru like figure at the Thailand beach resort. Mook finds herself entangled in a romantic friendship with one of the resort’s security guards, Gaitok (played by Tayme Thapthimthong). Speaking to Variety, Lisa said that Mook is quite like she is, “but flirtier and lady-like—I’m more like a tomboy.” Speaking to press at the LA event, she said: “It is my first acting [experience] so I don’t know what to expect on set, but everybody just being so supportive helped me a lot. So thank you, everyone.” Regardless, Lisa’s red carpet transformation continues to blossom. Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

The Top 8 Spring 2025 Fashion Trends You Can Shop and Wear Now,https://www.vogue.com/article/spring-2025-fashion-trends,"February 14, 2025",By Madeline Fass,"All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, we may earn affiliate revenue on this article and commission when you buy something. While strong notions of femininity prevailed in the spring/summer collections, the spring/summer 2025 fashion trends we’re predicting to take over the fashion landscape are less ethereal and dreamy as they are practical and empowering. Rooted in a sense of “soft power,” which Vogue’s Laird Borelli-Persson connected to designers encouraging “an openness to a sense of wonder” in her analysis of the shows, these trends can be embraced in more ways than one. And key themes can already be incorporated into your wardrobe. Consider spring’s outerwear stories, which reimagine lightweight jackets of all types, particularly sporty styles for the season ahead. For inspiration on how to wear these jackets from now, look no further than Bottega, where an elasticated windbreaker was styled with fluid trousers. A zip-up à la Gucci works equally well here—just throw an overcoat on top. Suede will continue to trend as well, so if you invested last fall, keep wearing it! Dark chocolate brown styles pair particularly nicely with spring’s softer color palette of wispy pinks and pale yellows. As for the print that reigned supreme on the spring/summer runways? It wasn’t a floral or an animal but plaid, and its first cousin, gingham. The autumnal pattern was already a favorite last fall, and it seems like fashion wasn’t done with it for spring, rendering it in softer colors and shapes. If you wardrobe already has a spirited amount of checks, look to the runways for ideas on how to print clash—another major theme this spring that was put forward at Dries Van Noten, Gucci, and Miu Miu, where high-impact, retro-inspired prints were piled on in an artfully chaotic manner. (If it looks wrong, it’s probably right.) These and more key spring/summer 2025 fashion trends to know and shop now as spring deliveries land in stores. Runway: Miu Miu Spring 2025; Rabanne Spring 2025; Prada Spring 2025; Tory Burch Spring 2025; Proenza Schouler Spring 2025 Inspired by sunny weekends on the coast, but really foil for any kind of weather or locale, the abundance of seaside-inspired pieces offer imaginative dressing solutions that are both practical and seasonally appropriate. Key pieces include anything with a sailor stripe, buoyant cotton skirts and dresses, and wind-resistant jackets—it does get blustery out there! Proenza Schouler Yves stripe fringed knit dress BERGDORF GOODMAN Miu Miu Panama cotton and technical pongé blouson jacket MIU MIU Nili Lotan Noemi lace-up striped cashmere hoodie NET-A-PORTER SHOPBOP Jil Sander pleated twill wide-leg pants NET-A-PORTER Tory Burch mini cotton dress TORY BURCH NET-A-PORTER Prada pleated midiskirt SAKS FIFTH AVENUE Runway: Versace Spring 2025; Dries Van Noten Spring 2025; Valentino Spring 2025; Miu Miu Spring 2025; Gucci Spring 2025 Maximalists will always have print, and this season encourages us to revisit the art of the clash with retro-inspired patterns. A devil-may-care approach will be rewarded here, but if your less-is-more tendencies are too strong to rebel against, a graphic top or skirt (ideally one that looks, or is, vintage) will do trick. Denim with trims, per Valentino, can achieve the same mix-and-match effect. Versace Wave jacquard knit fitted polo shirt VERSACE Dries Van Noten satin-jacquard midi skirt NET-A-PORTER SSENSE Miu Miu double-breasted printed natté coat MIU MIU Chloé lace-trimmed silk tiered slipdress SAKS FIFTH AVENUE NET-A-PORTER SSENSE Gucci printed silk shirt with self-tie GUCCI Valentino metallic jacquard-trimmed straight-leg jeans NET-A-PORTER SAKS FIFTH AVENUE FWRD Runway: Khaite Spring 2025; Proenza Schouler Spring 2025; Diotima Spring 2025; Alaïa Spring 2025; Carven Spring 2025 Texture, fringe, and crochet can do much for a minimalist wardrobe with very little. The idea here isn’t to do away with the clean line entirely, but rather play up those refrained sensibilities with novelty and craft. Even purists will enjoy styling these pieces. Khaite Avalon dress KHAITE Diotima Darliston skirt FWRD High Sport Louis fringed cotton-blend jacquard straight-leg pants NET-A-PORTER Simkhai Sonia fringe knit dress SIMKHAI MODA OPERANDI Mango silk blouse with asymmetrical neckline MANGO Proenza Schouler Phia skirt in leather silk fringe PROENZA SCHOULER Runway: Victoria Beckham Spring 2025; Issey Miyake Spring 2025; Bally Spring 2025; Loewe Spring 2025; Tod’s Spring 2025 Sculptural shapes alluding to a Japanese-style minimalism will inspire you to look differently at your everyday staples. These boisterous, asymmetric, and fanned-out silhouettes offer a true fashion POV to pieces you might wear everyday, from white T-shirts to nipped-in jackets. Khaite Nando jacket KHAITE Bally wool-blend midiskirt LUISA VIA ROMA Loewe draped T-shirt LOEWE Jacquemus Agave drop-waist pleated flare mididress BERGDORF GOODMAN Magda Butrym wool and silk-blend peplum blazer NET-A-PORTER Alaïa peplum wide-leg pants FWRD Runway: Loewe Spring 2025; Valentino Spring 2025; Marina Moscone Spring 2025; Alexander McQueen Spring 2025; Erdem Spring 2025 Soft pastels brought romance and airiness to the runways, but the color palette didn’t feel overly feminine. Even minimalists will be drawn to this season’s wispy pinks and pale yellows, which look great against wardrobe neutrals like grey, navy, and even chocolate brown suede. Alexander McQueen women's plissé blouse ALEXANDER MCQUEEN Oscar de la Renta tiered floral-print silk-blend georgette mini dress NET-A-PORTER Simone Rocha ruffle frill multi-seam maxi dress SSENSE Ulla Johnson Eve dress ULLA JOHNSON Acne Studios layered distressed chiffon and floral-print crepe skirt NET-A-PORTER Banana Republic chiffon twist-neck top BANANA REPUBLIC Runway: Loewe Spring 2025; Bottega Veneta Spring 2025; Prada Spring 2025; Miu Miu Spring 2025; Gucci Spring 2025 A sporty sensibility carried over from fashion’s Olympics fervor pervaded the spring/summer 2025 runways. Sabato de Sarno showed various fitted zip-up jackets at Gucci, while Bottega and Miu Miu reimagined the wind breaker—Matthieu Blazy notably lined his in plaid, a carryover from fall we’ll get into next. But other kinds of lightweight outerwear were anlso introduced. At Prada, Miuccia and Raf Simons showed a suede style, proof that fashion’s ongoing obsession with the texture isn’t going anywhere. A cropped leather cape made an appearance at Loewe, upleveling the boho staple we were reacquainted with last spring. Investing in next-season outerwear now doesn’t mean you have to wait until March to wear your pieces—layer similar styles from Gucci and Loewe under heavier coats to maximize their cost per wear. Gucci embroidered wool and silk hooded jacket GUCCI Sacai twill-paneled hoodie MYTHERESA & Other Stories belted patch-pocket jacket & OTHER STORIES Loewe balloon jacket in nappa lambskin LOEWE Miu Miu Technical silk zipper jacket MIU MIU Skall Studio Gaby jacket FWRD Runway: Acne Studios Spring 2025; Kallmeyer Spring 2025; Tod’s Spring 2025; The Row Spring 2025; Bottega Veneta Spring 2025 Plaid may be synonymous with fall—where it indeed saw a resurgence this season—but its presence in the spring collections takes on a softer tune. Borelli-Persson described these checks best as “Nirvana meets Country Living… for any season or type of weather” in her trend report. The Row’s ‘Tavishina’ coat in look 29 exemplifies the fashion mood, with an energizing combination of beige, black, and baby blue squares that was styled with pinstripe pants and a plain white button-up for a harmonious, minimalist-approved take on print mixing. Blazy meanwhile played with a classic color scheme of browns, greys, and white, but showed it as an oversized shacket meets coat hybrid. At Tod’s checks were playfully introduced once more, worn inside out as a full ensemble. In New York, Daniella Kallmeyer furthered the artful drape with a fluid blouse, while Acne Studios dabbled in the art of the clash (nails included!) and incorporated another theme seen in the resort 2025 trends: the bubble hem. This ’90s-inspired look can be achieved now with printed pieces from the likes of Massimo Dutti, Ralph Lauren, or Zara—and styled with pattern opposites for a true runway-coded look. The Row Tavishina coat THE ROW Bottega Veneta gingham cotton dress BOTTEGA VENETA High Sport Asher gingham jacquard top NET-A-PORTER Posse Mackenzie trousers POSSE Loewe cropped plaid shirt LOEWE Zara gingham midiskirt ZARA Runway: Tory Burch Spring 2025; Stella McCartney Spring 2025; Bottega Veneta Spring 2025; Saint Laurent Spring 2025; Bally Spring 2025 We’re leaving the office siren behind for spring, and embracing new tailoring codes for 2025. Simone Bellotti suggested a nipped in peplum shape with drop shoulders at Bally, Stella McCartney went ’80s oversize, Tory Burch introduced a collarless, belted, and wrapped silhouette, and Blazy showed an almost cartoonishly oversize take at Bottega. A happy medium can be found at Saint Laurent, where the many full suiting looks in the collection were inspired by the house founder, and meant to convey “control and power,” as designer Anthony Vaccarello told Vogue’s Mark Holgate post-show backstage.

I Need Celebrities to Stop Changing Clothes Every Five Seconds,https://www.vogue.com/article/i-need-celebrities-to-stop-changing-clothes-every-five-seconds,"February 14, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Last week, Anya Taylor-Joy spent the day running around New York City to promote her forthcoming film The Gorge. In one day alone, the actor wore five separate outfits—ranging from a sensational Alexander McQueen shearling coat to a mod Celine skirt suit and a brown leather Loewe trapeze jacket. Taylor-Joy is far from the only celebrity to change outfits at light speed: Keke Palmer, Blake Lively, and Sydney Sweeney have all recently churned out scores of looks in a short amount of time. Beyond street style, awards shows and red carpets have become an opportunity for outfit changes galore. At the Grammys, Doechii and Chappell Roan were among the artists to switch up their looks—Doechii in a parade of custom Thom Browne, Roan in a series of rodeo clown-inspired outfits. Recently, the speed at which celebrities change clothing seems to be reaching terminal velocity. Sure, there is a logic behind this phenomenon: they are usually in the throes of a press tour, taping junkets, talk shows, and social spots on a condensed timeline. Changing outfits offers the illusion that celebrities have more hours in the day than the rest of us, that they can fulfill endless professional obligations. Why, after all, would we want to know that an actor did GMA, a Buzzfeed puppy interview, and Hot Ones all in the same day? That would shatter the fantasy of promotional work as breezy and fun. Meanwhile, when it comes to awards shows, a roster of outfit changes can tell a story and convey power, something both Doechii and Chappell Roan executed at the Grammys. Both singers, nominated for Best New Artist, pulled off major fashion flexes in what the Recording Academy considers their freshman year: Roan changed from archival Jean Paul Gaultier couture into custom Thom Browne, while Doechii rocked four custom looks (also by Browne) over the course of the evening. But, be it street style or red carpet dressing, constantly changing outfits dilutes the power of the fashion. One can only imagine all of the time and effort that goes into making or procuring a garment—sourcing, shipping, tailoring—just for it to be worn for only a few minutes. It also causes red carpet moments to lose their salience. After all, who cares what a celebrity is wearing on the red carpet when we know they’re about to head inside and change? It’s not a problem contained to the fashion industry. We as a culture have a voracious appetite for newness, constant stimulation. But this ecosystem of nonstop changing is wildly unsustainable in terms of the environment, labor, and time. Going forward, celebrities and their stylists would be better served curating fashion moments that promote quality over quantity. After all, we only have so many hours in the day: why waste it changing every hour when one great look is all it takes?

Timothée Chalamet Takes a Page Out of Kendrick Lamar’s Book in Bootcut Jeans,https://www.vogue.com/article/timothee-chalamet-bootcut-jeans-kendrick-lamar,"February 14, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Timothée Chalamet is the latest male celebrity to hop aboard the bootcut jean train. Following Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime performance in light wash Celine flares, we began to wonder: Will men buy into the look? Chalamet is answering with a resounding yes. Today, Chalamet continued his endless press tour for A Complete Unknown at the Berlinale. Braving the snowy Berlin weather, the Oscar nominee cocooned himself in a vintage yellow and black striped Columbus Crew Adidas zip-up. He also expended his ever-growing scarf collection with the pièce de résistance of all scarves: a white Alexander McQueen printed with black skulls. But the real star of the show (no pun intended) was Chalamet’s light wash bootcut jeans, which pooled around his Asics: The pants were studded with moons and stars, adding some celestial flair to his already maximalist look. The bold jeans are from Kikunobu in Japan. Given that he was just in the country for more press, it’s possible he picked them up while traveling. Seeing as Chalamet and Lamar share the same stylist, Taylor McNeill, it’s not a huge surprise to see the actor rocking a similar pair of pants. But there are key differences: while Lamar’s Celine jeans clung to his thighs before flaring out below the knee, Chalamet’s fit looser on his body, though there is still a noticeable flare. While there’s been plenty of discourse about the difference between flare and bootcut jeans, we’ll have to place Chalamet in the bootcut camp for now. Regardless, it’ll give him and Lamar lots to discuss next time they link up. Later on in the evening, Chalamet slipped into something a little more comfortable. With his girlfriend Kylie Jenner joining him in Berlin, he honored the holiday in a custom pale pink ensemble from Chrome Hearts. Looking like a lost cast member from Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, Chalamet wore a tank top and trousers with a hoodie and even a pair of matching pink lug sole boots. He accessorized with a resplendent diamond tennis necklace from Cartier and a long-stemmed pink rose in hand. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. The couple settled in for a V-day date night at the German premiere of A Complete Unknown, sitting beside each other in the cinema room and sharing a kiss.

Lady Gaga and Anya Taylor-Joy Cosign the Return of the Can Can Boot,https://www.vogue.com/article/lady-gaga-and-anya-taylor-joy-cosign-the-return-of-the-can-can-boot,"February 14, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"It should come as no surprise that A Star Is Born lead Lady Gaga is a musical theater afficionado. But the singer even managed to incorporate a nod into her latest look. Yesterday, Gaga arrived at rehearsals for SNL’s 50th anniversary special dressed in an austere all-black look from Willy Chavarria’s fall 2025 collection: a black midi coat dress with a structured shoulder, swishy hem, and white kerchief peeking out of her breast pocket. But we couldn’t help but notice the singer’s shoes: a pair of pointy-toe lace-up booties—Jimmy Choo’s Scarlett boots, to be exact. The calf-high boot looked like a high-fashion reimagining of the Can Can boot, or something worn by a very chic member of The Music Man cast. Anya Taylor-Joy and Malcolm McRae in New York. Great minds think alike, it turns out. Last night, Anya Taylor-Joy also sported a pair of lace-up boots while attending Danielle Haim’s birthday party at Joyface in Manhattan’s East Village—albeit a much different interpretation. Taylor-Joy chose a pair of banana yellow KNWLS boots, complete with a pointy toe, buckle detail, and exaggerated tongue. The statement-making shoes served as a bright pop of color against her brown suede trench coat and black leather gloves.

How to Choose the Best Glasses for Your Face Shape,https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-choose-the-best-glasses-for-your-face-shape,"February 14, 2025",By Jessie Heyman,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. I’ve always had trouble with glasses. While I find them adorable—even chic!—on other people, I’ve long felt that once I put on a pair, my look becomes very “finals week,” very quickly. For years, I tried to turn a blind eye to the whole thing, blithely waving at strangers and squinting at street signs. But it was only a matter of time, I knew, before I had to succumb to spectacles. (Also: Because I’m not one for touching my eyes, contacts were a non-starter.) So, I gave myself a mission: If I was to become a glasses person, I simply needed to find the best pair out there. We’ve seen how they can be a powerful, even evocative accessory. (Meryl Streep has practically made a career out of the dramatic handling of eyewear.) And there’s never been a shortage of design-forward options—just look at the spring runways, where sultry little spectacles abound. To wit: Just last week, the Khaite show accessorized chunky knits, smart trousers, and tailored jackets with ascot caps, sharp handbags, and a sprinkling of elegant eyewear. As Vogue Runway Director Nicole Phelps wrote in her review, designer Catherine Holstein’s success at Khaite comes down to how good she is with product. “Look around at the front rows during fashion month and a good percentage of women will be wearing her Nevada boots,” Phelps wrote, “others are carrying her Simona shoulder bag, or wearing her jeans.” Now, Khaite has added optical eyewear to its collection of covetable staples. A look from the recent Khaite collection, featuring the brand's new eyewear. Created in collaboration with the heritage eyewear brand Oliver Peoples, which also helped to launch Khaite’s debut sunglasses collection in the fall of 2023, the new line is made up of six styles in all, featuring three pairs of opticals: two cat-eyed silhouettes (one in metal, the other in a bold acetate) and a ‘70s-inspired oversized pair. Eagle-eyed fashion folk may recognize the golden corewire that runs the length of the frame as a nod to the hardware in Khaite’s bags. All three styles feel like a natural extension of Khaite’s signature cool-but-wearable look. “There’s a quiet confidence to opticals, a refinement that is part of your daily uniform,” Holstein tells Vogue. “We wanted these frames to feel inherently Khaite—understated and intentional.” My vision may be blurry, but even I can see that there has never been a better time to give glasses a go. I traveled to Oliver Peoples’s Madison Avenue shop to try some on. Below, the best tips for choosing truly inspired eyewear. There’s a bit of a science to choosing your ideal glasses shape—though it’s a deeply individual practice. George Lee, who has worked with Oliver Peoples for 12 years, breaks down the formula for selecting the most flattering eyeglasses for different face shapes. It’s all about balance: While those with triangular faces—characterized by a wider forehead and smaller chin—should opt for smaller frames, a narrower forehead and wider jawline are well served by larger frame. Similarly, if you have a square face, Lee suggests picking frames that are a bit rounded, to give your visage a touch of softness; and for round faces, square-shaped glasses will give your look greater definition. Generally speaking, you don’t want your glasses to obscure your brows: Ideally, the top of the frame will follow the brow bone and fall slightly below your eyebrows. As far as your coloring goes, the rule of thumb is to try to create contrast, but if you’re new to the optical game, something classic—say, a relatively thin oval or soft square acetate frame in black or tortoiseshell—will do just fine. If you are blessed with a lower prescription, your frames can come in virtually any size or style. Higher prescriptions, on the other hand, narrow the field a bit, tending to require smaller frames with thicker edges. Lee is careful about how many frames he shows each client; he doesn’t tend to pull more than 10-12 in total, so as not to overwhelm them with options. He also thinks it’s best to try glasses on solo, rather than choosing by committee. (Selfies, however, are fair game, and I’d suggest industriously circulating all options among your trusted council.) Just like clothing, eyewear is ultimately an extension of your taste and style: What makes a pair of glasses “good” comes down to what makes you happy. In my case, I followed Lee’s step-by-step guidance and selected a pair of delicately rounded specs that gave my brows plenty of room to breathe and balanced out (but didn’t overwhelm) my oval-shaped face. Their color—tortoiseshell with an ivory interior—played off both my lighter complexion and dark hair. Looking at my reflection, it was the first time I’d ever felt like myself in a pair of glasses. “Eyewear is about how you want to look as well as what’s flattering,” Lee told me at the end of our tutorial. “If you can combine that with what works aesthetically, it really hits.” Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1978RX eyeglasses OLIVER PEOPLES Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1953RX eyeglasses KHAITE Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1953RX eyeglasses KHAITE Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1998RX eyeglasses KHAITE Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1978RX eyeglasses OLIVER PEOPLES Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1953RX eyeglasses KHAITE Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1998RX eyeglasses KHAITE Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1953RX eyeglasses OLIVER PEOPLES Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

Allow Zoë Kravitz to Introduce the Winter Sandal,https://www.vogue.com/article/zoe-kravitz-winter-sandal,"February 14, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"The snow from this week’s storm hasn’t even melted in New York City, but that didn’t stop Zoë Kravitz from breaking out her summer sandals. The actor and director arrived at Danielle Haim’s birthday party alongside Cara Delevingne and her Big Little Lies costar Shailene Woodley. While all of them bundled up for the blustery weather, Kravitz wasn’t going to let the cold stop her sartorial vision. She styled a pair of black leather kitten heeled ankle strap sandals with low-denier black tights. The open-toed shoe in freezing temps wasn’t the only so-called “fashion rule” that Kravitz broke last night. She bundled up in a calf-length black coat, which she paired with a navy blue fringed scarf. While the notion that one can’t wear black and navy together is outdated, here it serves as a reminder that Kravitz is wont to do what she pleases—rules (and snow) be damned. The actor finished off her look with a simple black leather envelope bag from Saint Laurent complete with a gold crossbody chain, which she matched to her smattering of gold jewelry. Amidst a sea of partygoers in wild outfits galore, Zoë Kravitz reminded us that sometimes breaking the rules can be a quiet act.

The 17 Most Stylish Celebrity Valentines,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/the-17-most-stylish-celebrity-valentines,"February 14, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Here at Vogue, there’s nothing we love more than a stylish celebrity couple. Personal style obviously conveys a great deal about the wearer, but a couple’s style gives us a peek into their dynamic. On one end of the spectrum, we have duos like Tom Holland and Zendaya, who are all in on coordination—be it their errands ’fits or their event looks. On the other end is Hailey Bieber and Justin Bieber, who often look as though they got dressed with entirely different briefs. The current reigning champions of celebrity couple style are Rihanna and A$AP Rocky, who never miss an opportunity to flex their fashion muscles. At the 2024 Fashion Awards, Rocky opted for an understated navy Bottega Veneta suit while Rihanna chose a dramatic vintage Christian Lacroix number complete with a feathered hat. And that’s nothing to say of their impeccable date night style, which they regularly flaunt on the streets of New York and Los Angeles. Red carpet couple style is an art form of its very own. At the 2024 Emmys, Saoirse Ronan and Jack Lowden made their red carpet debut as a married couple after secretly tying the knot in July. For their first appearance, Ronan met the moment in a navy blue draped Louis Vuitton two-piece, while Lowden coordinated in a matching navy tuxedo with black lapels. Meanwhile, on the 2024 Met Gala carpet, Queen Latifah and Eboni Nichols made a splash in custom Thom Browne. Happy Valentine’s Day from Vogue!

Jennifer Lawrence Adds a Maternity Wardrobe Must-Have to Her Outfit Rotation,https://www.vogue.com/article/jennifer-lawrence-maternity-wardrobe-track-pants,"February 14, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Up against the sartorial challenge of braving the frigid New York weather and dressing for the final trimester of pregnancy, Jennifer Lawrence comes up tops. Over the last several months, Jennifer Lawrence’s maternity wardrobe has run the gamut: bump-hugging LBDs and comfy but still cool shoes, adapted modern classics, archival couture and a good measure of excellent denim—all while never losing sight of her key colors and long-loved labels of choice. The actor was photographed out in New York City once again running some errands and braving the relentless chill, relying on a rotation of reworn pieces that included a blue lumberjack-check shirt and oversized leather jacket. A new and necessary addition to Lawrence’s maternity wardrobe was a pair of cobalt blue and yellow track pants. Comfortable, cool, and matching her phone case. Lawrence also wore her hair in thick plaits, and donned a pair of orange lensed, oval sunglasses. Track pants are a key staple for anyone’s wardrobe, easily pulled on to run to the shops and dressed up for easy elevation with cool layers, other textures and patterns, if you’re to follow J-Law’s style codes. The striking shade of blue is becoming a bit of a calling card for Lawrence, overtaking her love of a “pop of red.” Cobalt has been punctuating her looks of more muted tones—an easy style trick to polish any outfit. Jennifer Lawrence dons her new shade of choice. The classic flannel is also a regular reach for Lawrence: whether in this lumberjack style or a gingham check. And with temperatures set to stay freezing, she’ll remain ensconced in her enviable coat collection too. The overarching theme of J-Law’s maternity closet? Snuggly-chic.

"10 Seasons In, the Black in Fashion Council Discovery Showroom Continues to Transform the Industry",https://www.vogue.com/article/fall-2025-black-in-fashion-council-discovery-showroom,"February 13, 2025",By Jasmine Fox-Suliaman,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. On the surface, one could surmise that things have shifted for the better in the fashion industry for Black creatives in the last few seasons. We’ve seen a massive influx of private investment into small businesses, 28 major retailers signed onto the Fifteen Percent Pledge to stock-list Black-owned brands, and history was made when Maximilian Davis and Pharrell Williams were appointed as the first Black creative directors for their respective fashion houses, Ferragamo and Louis Vuitton. But still, given the current political climate, it’s clear for many that the work has only just begun—at least that was our consensus after chatting with designers at the Black in Fashion Council’s Fall 2025 Discovery Showroom. Despite ongoing discussions around the importance of diversity in fashion, the industry itself is still largely exclusionary. Only 7% to 10% of small fashion businesses are Black owned; of that slim margin, only 1% is currently sold in major retailers. If that weren’t emblematic enough of a systemic imbalance, one only needs to look at who is appointed to the lofty positions in major luxury fashion houses to notice the lack of actual change. As reported by Vogue Business, only eight women and four people of color currently hold creative director roles at the major luxury fashion houses, none of which is held by a Black woman. That staggering reality was something that came up at this season’s showroom as designer Nia Thomas admitted, “There’s not a lot of examples for me to look up to as an African American woman working in the luxury fashion industry in the United States, so I’ve come to accept that maybe I have to break down some of those barriers myself.” It wasn’t just one designer who voiced this concern, as even a late-night call with Rene Moshi Macdonald of Lisou led her to question why a major fashion house has yet to name a Black woman to a creative director post. “What the hell is that all about?” she asked. For all of the perceived “progression” that occurred the past few years, it’s become clear to many Black creatives that the only way forward isn’t to continue asking for a seat at the table but to build their own spaces from the jump. One could argue that perspective has been the guiding principle behind why Sandrine Charles and Lindsay Peoples started the Black in Fashion Council. While other organizations have floundered to create such a space in the existing ecosystem, the Council has flourished by creating its own. Over the past five years, the organization has given a platform to more than 75 designers from across the globe, including Diotima, Theophilio, and House of Aama. While its longevity is worth celebrating—which was done so with a dinner party—it’s not lost on the founders that there’s still more work to do in the industry. “We are thrilled to reach the milestone of 10 seasons hosting the Black in Fashion Council Discovery Showroom, but our goal moving forward is to continue to evolve the showroom efforts, the designer footprint, and the overall experience,” Charles told Vogue at the fall 2025 presentation. While systemic change in the broader fashion industry will no doubt take time to achieve, the showcase has been a conduit for building community. Whether hailing from the shores of Haiti or a few stops into the borough of Brooklyn, creatives have come together consecutively to create meaningful relationships at the Council. It’s that connection that compelled Vogue to shuffle through the snow down to Manhattan’s Financial District on a particularly frigid afternoon during New York Fashion Week to interview each of them. Ahead, the 10 designers discuss their labels, what the showcase means to them, and their vision for the future of fashion. “I’ve always been a texture freak,” Nia Thomas unabashedly admitted as she talked us through the inspiration behind her fall 2025 collection. Like most New York–born designers, Thomas has a terrific sense of humor that allows her to poke fun at herself. But make no mistake: Her work is no laughing matter. Thomas has built her namesake brand over the past seven years by wielding artisan techniques to transform some of the most unyielding textiles into creations that beg to be touched. Although she’s become known for her crochet knitwear, she stretched her skill set into new terrain this season by debuting her first-ever leather pieces. Arguably some of her most substantial work yet, small strips of lilac leather were strung together to create a see-through halter top; saffron leather fringe was used to create a slip dress resemblant of a fishing net; and even the traditional woven handbag was given a scrumptious update in the tiny chocolate brown tote. But her ingenuity didn’t end with her leatherwork, as even the most perfunctory everyday items couldn’t seem to escape her grip—e.g., silk ribbons sourced from an office supply closing sale in Mexico City were inevitably woven into a sleek floor-length gown. No matter the source material, every tiny detail seemed to exemplify Thomas’s aspiration: to create her own tangible world that you could touch. Serendipitously, a year before the Detroit-born designer Aaron Potts was asked to partake in Black in Fashion Council’s debut showroom, he struck out on his own to start his label. “I can’t even fathom that it’s been five years since I first showed with them. What it did for my brand was transformational,” he said. “It set me on a new course and connected me to this community of creative people.” It’s wild to think how much the world has changed since then, but for Potts, his perspective on the importance of this work has not. “With the current political and cultural state, it is even more imperative for communities [like ours] to build on our own so that we are not beholden to the system,” he explained. With over 20 years as a career designer, Potts is no stranger to how the industry works, but he’s no longer interested in letting it tamper his joy: “My fall collection was a real turning point for me. With the election and all the craziness we’ve been subjected to, I knew that if I dove into my work, it would help me get out of that dark place.” That spirit is imbued into the fall collection in the form of colorful chunky knits, voluminous silhouettes, and French terry cotton covered in fun motifs. It symbolizes the shift from the surface level to something more important to him: people. “I don’t care about the clothes,” he said. “The collection is just a conduit; it’s a tool for connecting people and helping them find themselves.” “Before I understood the concept of fashion as a job, I felt like it was a way for you to bridge the gap between people’s differences. Styling, for me, has always been the simplest way to create community,” Larissa Muehleder said as we stood next to the collection she had managed to design in just 30 days. Even though Muehleder grew up in New York City, nothing made her feel “less alone” quite like creating clothing, so it’s no surprise that she was compelled to start her own bespoke label back in 2014. Although it’s been over a decade since the inception of Muehleder, there’s still a sort of childlike sparkle in her eyes that reflects her innate desire to create connection through design. The fall collection valorizes this concept by exploring the “multi-facetedness of being a woman” through pieces that can be worn various ways—such as a sharply structured cobalt blue blazer adorned with bows that can be worn as outerwear or a short dress, and an asymmetrical silk charmeuse blouse in a soft eggshell that can be styled as a bubble-hem dress or bundled around the hips as a shirt. Like the designer herself, every piece in the collection has an innate duality that reminds us that the things we think divide us can actually bring us together—if we’re willing to connect the dots. What stories get to be a part of the tapestry of America’s history? It’s not a new question by any means, but it’s something that New York–based designer Daveed Baptiste clearly thinks about a lot. Before the Haiti-born creative spent time trying to recount the tales of those who came before him through his ready-to-wear collections, Baptise’s journey began when he fell in love with fashion photography. In many ways, his passion for the glossy editorials showcased in Vogue is what sparked his desire to start his brand in 2023. “Storytelling is the thread between my photography and my design work. I’m telling stories about the Caribbean diaspora; I’m telling stories about Haitian immigrants. It’s the same story but in a different medium,” he said. It’s rare for an artist to be able to successfully work with multiple mediums—much less reflect all of the tough realities of humanity through textile manipulation—but Baptiste does so masterfully in a way that’s reminiscent of Glenn Martens and John Galliano. In particular, the most noteworthy piece from his debut collection is a light-wash distressed denim coat with a raised appliqué made from tubing that has been warped to wrap around the shoulders, bodice, and waist in a way that’s meant to mimic the migration routes used to get to the promised land. Although not a light topic to explore, a general jovial and celebratory spirit is attached to the collection through how denim dramatically drapes down the form or zippers expose an accordion of pleats. Baptiste understands that the narrative around immigration has only gotten more negative in recent months, but he gets to decide how to tell his own story with everything he creates. With so many hurdles for aspiring designers, it’s understandable that Fumi Egbon first found the idea of entering the industry intimidating. “I knew I wanted to get into fashion, but not seeing many people who look like me made me think it might not be as easy,” she said. Any initial trepidation Egbon may have had didn’t stand in her way for too long, though, as she took a leap of faith in founding her size-inclusive label amid the pandemic with no traditional fashion background to rely on. But that tenacious spirit is what has set apart her clothing from the crowd: Hand-knitted coats come with collars covered in tactile fringe; body-con knit dresses are spun from bright shades of sapphire; and the classic cropped cardigan comes alive with oversized cocoon sleeves. Her ability to take risks has paid off, as she’s shown her collection not once, but twice, at the Black in Fashion Council showroom. “I’m from Nigeria but live in Canada, so it’s harder to come by the same opportunities as American designers, but it’s great that the showroom is open to global brands. It’s allowed me to go to places that seemed unreachable before,” she said. If designer Heart Roberts looks familiar, it may be because his initial foray into fashion was as a model. Notably, his first runway show was for No Sesso’s fall 2022 collection. Although Roberts knew modeling wouldn’t be his career path forever, it was formative in unveiling his purpose: fashion design. “I didn’t realize I wanted to pursue designing until the pandemic,” he said. “At that point, I couldn’t find pants that fit my legs, so I thought, why can’t I just make them?” Soon, Roberts was spending his free time scouring bins at beloved vintage spots in Brooklyn in search of denim, fur, and other textiles to upcycle. But it wasn’t until this season’s Black in Fashion Council Showroom that Roberts finally decided to show his first collection for Hearthrob. After spending more than a year studying source materials such as the film Resident Evil and the entire Walking Dead comic series, he titled the collection Apocalypse. While the general aesthetic of the range is described by Roberts as “beautiful chaos”—think ultrabaggy jeans covered in an array of distressed denim patchwork and a white leather blazer with a hand-painted contrasting black trim—there’s a deeper linguistic and design choice happening here. “The Greek meaning of the word apocalypse is “the great unveiling,” so this is like the great unveiling of my brand,” he explained. “With this collection, I wanted to explore the consensus of these films, where people are coming together as a community to defeat things that are unnaturally against us, against things that we can’t control.” In an age when it’s easy to feel like everything is the end of the world, where we’re in constant fear over the state of our planet, it can be comforting to connect with someone just to chat about some cool upcycled jeans. It’s not revolutionary, but it gives us one more familiar face in a new world. “I think immigration leaves a sort of wounding that we don’t often think about, right?” Busayo Olupona said when reflecting on what first compelled her to return to Nigeria to reconnect with her roots. Unbeknownst to her then, those trips would be the catalyst for her leaving her career as a lawyer to focus on building her namesake label in 2012. As with her approach to law school, Olupona spent so much of those first few years studying everything she possibly could in the business. However, no amount of reading could prepare her for the challenge of having to step back from the brand for a short time because it didn’t make financial sense. “I made so many mistakes in the beginning because I was trying to figure it all out on my own,” she admitted. But she wasn’t alone forever. Things began to change for the better when she started to connect with others in the fashion community through programs such as RaiseFashion and BIFC. “That changed the trajectory of my life and the business. It’s how I got picked up by Saks and Nordstrom,” she noted. While things have been great for the brand since then, there are still moments that Olupona struggles with navigating—mainly, how to balance her label’s commerciality with artistry: “I want to make wearable things, but what’s the point of creating something that doesn’t strike any emotion or doesn’t move people? It’s a complex, delicate balance for sure.” Despite her doubts, her fall 2025 collection masterfully weaves a thread between pragmatism and idealism—most notably through tailored shirtdresses hand-dipped in bright tie-dye and woven button-down shirts meant to resemble her ancestral fabric. Whatever initial wounds Olupona may have felt about her journey as an immigrant, a designer, or a human being, those seem to be long gone now: “When I started, I knew I wanted to reconnect with Nigeria. Something in my spirit was like, You’re gonna start going back home,’ but I could have never imagined it would have brought me here.” Craftsmanship inherently requires one to commit to carrying on knowledge from the past in the hopes of creating something new in the future—that’s something that designer Durrell Dupard has conquered without fail. Originally from New Orleans, Dupard doesn’t have a technical background in fashion but was taught to sew by his grandparents. Like many designers, creating first began as a form of self-expression, but Dupard slowly started to make bespoke creations as more people approached him, asking, “Can you make those for me?” The true catalyst that led him to start his label finally came from the personal tragedy of his grandmother’s, grandfather’s, and uncle’s deaths. “After they passed, I figured it would be a good way to honor them. Instead of being sad about it, [design] was like my stress reliever. It made me feel closer to them,” he said. While Dupard doubled down on his craft by launching his label in 2020—named after his late uncle—he didn’t come around to releasing his collection until this season’s Black in Fashion Council Showroom. Much like a flower that takes time to bloom after the deadening cold of winter, the collection drew inspiration from nature in New Orleans through dimensions, textures, and colors. As Dupard elaborates: “The collection is called Magnolia Muse, which is our state’s flower. I love nature; I wouldn’t say I grew up in the country, because it’s Louisiana, but I was drawing from the landscape.” The references are reflected the most in a single piece, the one that Dupard says is the embodiment of his creative journey: An androgynous leather puffer jacket is covered in a Technicolor floral print with clear drops on the outside meant to resemble all of the “rainy” periods in his life that led him to grow. “I think all forms of artistic impression, be it music, books, fashion, or sculpture, are stories of our time,” Rene Moshi Macdonald said emphatically, even though it must have felt like midnight for her as she grappled with jet lag. It seemed time was one of the most imperative parts of Macdonald’s story, as she didn’t set out to start her business, Lisou, until her late 40s, when her children had left the nest. “As they got older, they were the ones who encouraged me to start my brand. They said, ‘You’ve given us all this time, and now is your time.’” Macdonald may have gotten the initial blessing from her children to start her business—something that continues to this day, as her son was able to show up for her at the Black in Fashion Council Showroom while she was traveling through Thailand—but pivoting from her academic background as a professor at London University wasn’t as effortless. “I’m kind of the typical African girl, in the sense that, if I had told my dad, ‘I want to study fashion,’ he would have been like, ‘That’s a hobby,’” she said. It’s easy to glean that Macdonald’s early life was shaped by the fact her parents sacrificed so much to send her to boarding school as they worked for the United Nations, so it wasn’t until the right time in her life appeared that she felt free to explore her love for fashion. That feeling of liberation is embedded in every aspect of her work, especially in her ability to transform timeless silhouettes through Technicolor prints that she created herself. Possibly one of the best examples of how she’s able to use her academic background to inform her design aesthetic is the fall 2025 print she’s coined Afrocamo. Her son helped her print out every country on the continent of Africa, arranging them into a camolike print. “I wanted to do a collection about colonialism, which is why it’s called Empire, weaving the words we cannot speak, which sort of seems pertinent to the moment we currently find ourselves in,” she explained. Although the collection’s print centers on a serious topic, like all of Macdonald’s work, bright color palettes and portions make the pieces more approachable for wider audiences. Of course, she doesn’t necessarily design with the idea of reaching a specific consumer; rather, her approach is about unearthing the story that defines why she designs: “I spent so much time thinking about what my purpose was with Lisou, and then I came into the studio one day and my team had put these words on the wall that I used to say all the time: ‘Joy is our purpose.’” Community has become a word often thrown around as a marketing ploy, but for Shareef Mosby and Jon Cope, it’s central to everything they create. It was sort of fated that the head designer (Mosby) and fashion communication director (Cope) met many years ago: Both had familial ties to Richmond, Virginia, but didn’t cross paths until they randomly moved into the same apartment building over 15 years ago. One of the first signs that they’d work well together is how they instantly saw each other from the start; so rarely are we in community with someone by simply letting them be themselves. “I think that is what it’s about at the core of fashion. It’s about asking yourself, How can I find a way to vibe with this person who may be so different from me? Because, me and Shareef? I’m queer, and he’s straight, but he’s like my family; he listens to me and values what I have to say,” Cope said. Even as a bystander, it’s nearly impossible not to feel the admiration that these two have for each other; it’s affirmed by tiny little interactions, as when Mosby shared his nickname for Cope. “I call him V, because when I met him, he had all of these old copies of Vogue; he’s a voracious reader,” said Mosby. For both creatives, being able to honor each other’s differences has allowed them to explore parts of themselves that might be “uncomfortable” through the collections they create, which manifests as tailored staples with dark twists (e.g., a white deconstructed button-down shirt covered in grommets or sleek crescent bags covered in studs). “Designing is about being vulnerable; it’s about allowing ourselves to tap into our shadow sides, which is why we named the brand Victim15. We’re in this space of redefining what victim means and learning how to integrate that into our lives in a way that won’t bring us down but empower us,” Cope said. The symbiotic relationship between the two has allowed them to scale the brand in ways they could have never imagined, such as being able to financially support a creative team, showing their collection for the first time at the Black in Fashion Council Showroom, and, more recently, moving to Los Angeles to start a new chapter. When probed about their hopes for the brand’s future, Mosby admitted, “I’m trying to go on this journey without having too many huge expectations. But I think we’re finally coming into this space of being in community with everything around us; we’re exactly where we’re supposed to be.” Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

Working 9-to-5! Stars Are Showing How Winter Suits Are Done,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/winter-suits-2025-celebrity-trend-red-carpet,"February 13, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"A-list celebrities are hardly commuting to corporate 9-to-5 desk jobs every day—yet judging by their sleek array of winter suits, you could certainly assume that was the case. These past few months, well-clad stars such as Kendall Jenner, Rihanna, and Hailey Bieber have been spotted in classic two-pieces (whether skirt suits or pant versions) that could command any boardroom or high-up executive meeting. Though, office dressing is not the intention of their polished looks at all: With modern updates and cool accessories, their suiting moments are more so built for a day off—or for a fun night out. At first glance, the suits themselves are quite traditional. But how they've been styled makes all the difference. Take Rihanna, who elevated her gray blazer and trousers with the addition of an Hermès scarf tied around her neck, like a tie. On her feet, her patent Margiela Tabi heels lent a more progressive feel as well. Hailey Bieber, meanwhile, slipped into a vintage Mugler pinstriped skirt suit—but her sheer tights, pointed pumps, and itty-bitty shades made it all feel very 2025. Modernized silhouettes and hues also made the winter suits feel of-the-moment. In Saint Laurent, Nicole Kidman turned heads at the Critics Choice Awards in an oversized suit with pleated high-waisted pants. At the DGA Awards, Elle Fanning went streamlined in a new-Valentino suit, and the champagne-colored satin lapels and bowed cummerbund were perfect for evening. The 2025 approach to winter suits? It’s all about taking your timeless two-piece and giving it slight twist. Kind of like what your cool boss would wear to work. Below, more standout suit moments from winter 2025.

New York Fashion Week Street Style Embraced a Ladylike Agenda—7 Outfits to Re-create,https://www.vogue.com/article/new-york-fashion-week-looks-fw25,"February 13, 2025",By Cortne Bonilla,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. The fall 2025 New York Fashion Week shows have officially ended, and the city-dwelling street style scene is always one to watch. I mean, who does New York better than New Yorkers? Amid what felt like an eternity of larger-than-life silhouettes, it seems a new sartorial tide has turned. While you’ll never not see oversized shapes and head-to-boot monochromatic looks, a demure and sophisticated approach dominated the streets of Manhattan and Brooklyn: ladylike dressing. Structured jackets (some collarless, some cinched at the waist) first arrived on the scene last spring, and now we’re seeing these feminine sensibilities influence other categories. Showgoers embraced the modern lady, taking cues from the past with long leather gloves peeking out from elegant outerwear or affixed onto belts, brooches pinned to jacket lapels, and an array of silk scarves to add a burst of color and lightweight warmth (it’s still winter!). For an easy transition into the new season, there are a plethora of ladylike goodies—and styling tips—to take from the NYFW scene. From fitted coats and classic blazers to leather gloves, skinny belts, and more, here are our favorite street style looks to re-create from the uptown-meets-downtown-meets-Brooklyn crowd. Just when you think New York couldn’t get any gloomier, an eruption of vivid color emerges onto the scene.

"For Anya Taylor-Joy and Sabrina Carpenter, Diamonds Are a Back’s Best Friend",https://www.vogue.com/article/backward-necklace-trend-anya-taylor-joy-sabrina-carpenter-taylor-russell,"February 13, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Nowadays, celebrities are taking a subtler approach to their jewelry, flipping their necklaces around. Call it business in the front, diamonds in the back. Last night, Anya Taylor-Joy attended the premiere of her film The Gorge in a strapless white Dior minidress with a pleated capelet that fanned out like wings. She accessorized her avian dress with a platinum and diamond Tiffany & Co. Archives necklace, which she wore backward so that it sat atop her collarbone and draped delicately down her back. Taylor-Joy hasn’t been alone in rocking the backward necklace recently. Sabrina Carpenter walked the red carpet at the 2025 Grammys in a baby blue JW Anderson dress festooned with ostrich feathers. Instead of a traditional halter, a 50-carat brilliant-cut diamond necklace from Chopard stood in for the neckline, seemingly connected to the dress itself. Ever the fan of an Old Hollywood reference, Carpenter’s look nodded to Shirley MacLaine’s character Louisa May Foster in the 1964 film What a Way to Go! The backward trend picked up some steam at the 2024 Venice Film Festival when Taylor Russell gave the look a try. Whereas Taylor-Joy and Carpenter both opted for jewelry that draped down their back, Russell wore a shorter Tiffany & Co. necklace (with an 11-carat pear-cut diamond pendant) which sat just below the base of her neck, serving as the perfect compliment to her white dress, accessorized with a gauzy scarf. So next time you wear a top or dress with a low back, consider turning your jewelry around to add a sparkly surprise. Taylor Russell at the 2024 Venice Film Festival.

Jennifer Lawrence Adds a Modern Classic to Her Maternity Wardrobe,https://www.vogue.com/article/jennifer-lawrence-leopard-coat-winter-trend,"February 13, 2025",By Olivia Allen,"Somehow, it’s still coat season. Dressing for warmth and style is no mean feat, as all those who navigated freezing temperatures and sleet-soaked streets at New York Fashion Week will know, but Jennifer Lawrence, for one, has cracked the code. The actor, who is expecting her second child, stepped out in a leopard-print coat from By Malene Birger that channels ’60s mod energy with a 2025 flair. Considered a neutral by those in the know, a leopard coat is the ultimate winter wardrobe staple. J Law paired hers with The Row’s ludicrously capacious Park Tote and a pair of oversized tortoiseshell sunglasses: a masterclass in incognito chic. A fashion week favorite, the leopard-print coat has made a roaring comeback, this time in iterations that feel more timeless than trend-driven (lest we forget the 2014 Topshop coat that did the rounds). Gone are the fast-fashion versions of the past, this season’s take is all about refined silhouettes and grown-up fabrics. So, while a New York winter may be relentless, Jennifer proves that a statement coat is all you need to keep things fun when it’s freezing. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

Dua Lipa Is the Final Boss of This It Girl Coat,https://www.vogue.com/article/dua-lipa-penny-lane-coat,"February 13, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Penny Lane has the girls in a chokehold. From Bella Hadid to Taylor Swift and now, Dua Lipa. The fuzzy-trimmed collar coat, with its nipped in waist, harkens back to the 2000 cult classic film Almost Famous and its alluring character Penny Lane. The groupie and ‘band aid,’ played by Kate Hudson, has an enviable Afghan coat. Big collar, big personality. It’s become an it girl calling card this winter; Dua Lipa is the next to bundle up and ensconce herself in shearling. The musician opted for a shearling collar leather coat in a buttery burgundy leather from Bottega Veneta, paired with black trousers, snake print pointy boots, and a quilted Chanel bag (as the newly minted Chanel ambassador can). Plus, that headline-catching ring. While the rest of her outfit is slim and close-fitting, the plush and full-bodied coat collar is gargantuan—perfect for the London chill, and a quick escape into the night with partner Callum Turner. Lipa and Turner had been out on a date night, and were photographed leaving Chiltern Firehouse in the early hours of the morning. The shaggy-trimmed coat-of-the-moment has been having somewhat of a resurgence as a chic and functional piece of outerwear. Taylor Swift remains a devotee to British label Charlotte Simone’s faux-fur creations in pleasing cherry red tones and more classic styles, while Bella Hadid often mines the archive for vintage iterations by way of Dolce & Gabbana, giving them her own contemporary western core twist. Lipa’s winter wardrobe has been percolating with strong outwear and accessories—a bold snakeskin coat by Jil Sander, a plushy puffer jacket and a heavily charmed Hermès Birkin. Date night always requires a strong look—Turner and Lipa’s jaunt to Paris amid Couture Week was a sight to behold, with big bows and bigger, romantic restaurant bookings. Lipa is soon to jet off once again for the next leg of her Radical Optimism tour, which kicks off in Australia and New Zealand in March, travelling back to Europe and then to North America. The cozy coats will stay at home when she absconds to Oz, but now we’ve got Lipa’s summer wardrobe, bursting with bikinis and diaphanous beach dresses, to anticipate.

8 New York Fashion Week Moments You May Have Missed,https://www.vogue.com/article/8-new-york-fashion-week-moments-you-may-have-missed,"February 12, 2025",By Kelsey Stiegman,"“This and yap,” was the unofficial catchphrase of New York Fashion Week’s fall 2025 season. It captioned countless editor Instagram Stories and grid posts, often accompanied by a $25 bowl of pasta and a brimming martini (the standard fashion week fuel). For regular attendees, the biannual event is a time for market research and content creation—yes—but, most importantly, it’s a time to kiki. Though both garments and the designers who make them change with each season, one thing can always be counted on: the whispered commentary between seasoned editors as the runway music blares—and if not there, then in the backs of Lyfts, over cups of coffee, or via cleverly-named group chats. Though anyone can consume watered-down fashion week highlights through the second-hand perspective of a phone screen, it’s these private conversations between show-goers that truly speak to a collection’s success (or lack thereof). With New York City working hard to reclaim its title as a fashion capital of the world, this NYFW season provided plenty of off-the-cuff moments to inspire these exchanges. From sartorial seances and PETA protesters to celebrity run-ins, revisit the moments that had editors talking. Zoe Gustavia Anna Whalen fall 2025 On Feb. 10, designer Zoe Gustavia Anna Whalen hosted her first runway show on the CFDA calendar—“runway show” being a loose term. The candle-lit ceremony was more like a summoning circle than the traditional catwalk one would expect. Invited guests sat around a shadowy stage (on the wood floor, in some cases), observing models as they placed offerings on a center altar. Though the candles created ambience, some audience members were concerned for fire safety. It was certainly a memorable choice, given that fashion week has seen many an after-party shut down by the New York City fire marshals. Lisa Rinna closing Jane Wade fall 2025. The Real Housewives hive has been eating well this season, with cast members abandoning their respective cities for New York City’s fashion escapades. Events were so well-attended—with Luann de Lesseps, Dorinda Medley, Jenna Lyons, and Bronwyn Newport all making appearances—that one PR rep affectionately dubbed the week “Bravocon.” Even with the reality TV stars checking in at nearly every event, none incited a bigger frenzy than Lisa Rinna, who made a surprise performance at Jane Wade. Rinna played the part of the no-bullshit CEO, eliciting audible gasps from the crowd and closing the office-themed fashion show with a bang. As sure as fashion month is long, Coach’s show will inevitably be disrupted by protesters. Animal cruelty activists have started a tradition of sorts, habitually disrupting the label’s shows season after season after season. Security dragged one catwalk crasher out of the venue, down the front steps, and onto the curb like last night’s recycling. The protester continued to scream “leather kills” at the top of their lungs while being used as a human dust mop (the footage of which promptly made the rounds). After six days of nonstop clothing, the interruption actually energized weary show-goers, with some calling it a “highlight” of the week. Colleen Allen fall 2025 Colleen Allen fall 2025 In terms of memorability, the fresh-on-the-scene designer’s NYFW presentation rivaled household names. Allen opted out of the fashion show spectacle, instead hosting intimate appointments with a select few to show off her creations. Even without the theatrics of a choreographed runway, she was still able to make an impression on the minds and social media accounts of the industry insiders who viewed her work. Within hours, fashion-adjacent feeds were awash with the frilly bloomers and cerulean velvet coat she showed in her fall 2025 collection—the likes of which will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the most photographed pieces of the week. Kendall Jenner walking for Calvin Klein Collection fall 2025. Bad Bunny sitting front row at Calvin Klein Collection fall 2025. The reality TV star-turned-supermodel walked in Veronica Leoni’s first show for Calvin Klein Collection (and the brand’s first since 2017). Though Jenner was impeccably dressed in an outsized topcoat, it wasn’t her garb that had Slack channels buzzing, but her audience. Jenner walked the CK runway with ex-boyfriend Bad Bunny sitting front row. The question on editors’ lips and group chats was: Are they back together? Luar fall 2025 Patricio Campillo Brooklyn-based designer Raul Lopez used a homophobic slur as the inspiration for his upcoming line, reclaiming the term “el pato.” While his flamboyantly feathered accessories were a hit, a black T-shirt also got the message across: “I talk shit about you in Spanish.” Meanwhile, Patricio Campillo’s stage fell in line with the omnipresent workwear aesthetic—up until the creative director’s customary post-show appearance. He himself sported a tee that read “El Golfo de México,” a push-back against President Trump’s attempt to rename the body of water. Collina Strada fall 2025. Though Wiederhoeft was noticeably absent from this season’s lineup, Collina Strada stepped up to the plate, providing NYFW with some much-needed representation for the quirky bride community. Known for its emphasis on environmental responsibility, the cult-favorite brand employed a no-waste strategy, transforming vintage wedding dresses into, as founder Hillary Taymour wrote in her show notes, “modern Collina couture.” To present her secondhand confections, Taymour sent dual brides, turning the catwalk into a makeshift wedding aisle where the two shared a kiss, sealing their bond in holy sartorial matrimony. Delighted cheers from the audience continued until the show closed with a remix of “Cheetah Sisters” by the Cheetah Girls. Khaite fall 2025 Altuzarra fall 2025 Theophilio fall 2025 Khaite used their Feb. 8 runway as an opportunity to move away from their trademark bubble stud—a design detail that has defined their product offerings for years. Instead of merchandising outfits with Elena bags or Benny belts, the label embraced a different accessory, using ’30s-era ascot caps to accent more than a dozen looks. Altuzarra and Theophilio, on the other hand, utilized an even more obscure category of headwear. The former topped models with braided wool caps and embellished net styles, while the latter chose pillowy Renaissance-reminiscent landsknecht hats in animal prints and tartan plaid.

What Is the Difference Between Bootcut and Flare Jeans?,https://www.vogue.com/article/bootcut-jeans-vs-flare-jeans,"February 12, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"When Kendrick Lamar hit the stage at the Super Bowl Halftime Show, we had many pressing questions: What does his “a” necklace stand for? Would he perform “Not Like Us?” And most urgently, Where did he get those jeans? All questions were soon answered (the logo for Lamar’s communication company pgLang, but it served as a nice double entendre for his lyric “a minoooor”; yes and he called Drake out by name; Celine). But Lamar’s statement pants opened the gates to a new quandary: were they bootcut jeans or flares? The question made me pause. Are flares bootcuts like a square is a rectangle? Kind of. Flares seem more clear-cut: hip- and thigh-hugging pants that dramatically kick out at the knee. Another noted fan of the look is Pharrell Williams, whose proclivity for the retro pants has made its way into his Louis Vuitton menswear. Pharrell Williams in flare jeans. Bootcut jeans, however, seem to have some more leeway. They adopt a more straight-legged silhouette with a less exaggerated flare below the knee. Rather, they’re meant to accommodate a boot, not make a disco-inspired statement. While they can lean more bodycon, bootcut can also adopt a baggy form. Beloved by naughties royalty Beyoncé and Jennifer Aniston, they’ve found a new life in the 2020s, namely on models like Bella Hadid. (Given Hadid’s rodeo activities, it only makes sense she’d be into them.) While people remain divided, Celine weighed into the debate, categorizing Kendrick Lamar’s light-wash denim as flares. So at least one case is settled. Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

The Best Front Row Style From New York Fashion Week,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/new-york-fashion-week-front-row-celebrities-fall-2025,"February 12, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Brace yourselves! Another New York Fashion Week has officially arrived, and the new fall 2025 collections are sure to delight all fashion spectators. The official calendar features many exciting shows to look forward to: Christopher John Rogers! Luar! Tory Burch!—all guaranteed to have front rows filled with A-list celebrities. The always-buzzy Marc Jacobs show kicked off NYFW with a bang.

This Is Kate Middleton’s Hardest Working Coat—and It’s Bespoke,https://www.vogue.com/article/kate-middleton-princess-of-wales-bespoke-coat,"February 12, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"While the palace is supposedly moving away from reporting on Kate Middleton’s wardrobe, royal fans won’t have to dig too deep to get the details on the Princess of Wale’s current fashion. Yes, it’s another rewear. Catherine Princess of Wales made an appearance yesterday at a mother and baby unit at HMP Styal in Cheshire, England, where she met incarcerated women, staff, and advocates. The royal spoke with both formerly incarcerated women and those still in prison who access help from the charity Action for Children, where she is a royal patron. She wore a bespoke burgundy windowpane check Blaze Milano coat (which had been lengthened for the princess), a Gabriela Hearst turtleneck sweater, an Edeline Lee skirt, and brown pointed boots. Most recently, she wore this same, typical and elegant outfit to visit The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust—of which she and husband Prince William had been made patrons—where she met medical staff and patients. It was one of her first official royal appearances, marking a tentative return to duties now she is in remission from cancer. Kate also wore the coat back in December 2021 for Christmas Day mass. Kate Middleton on a previous visit to The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Kate Middleton has long been hailed the queen of coats, with outerwear being the style staple she returns to again and again. As well as this Blaze Milano coat, she often sports designs from London labels like Alexander McQueen and Catherine Walker. She is a devoted fan to tailoring, wearing double-breasted coats and more structured tuxedo styles for evening events. And of course, she’s dedicated to making the most out of what’s currently hanging in her closet, like the sensible houndstooth Zara dress that made another appearance last month. As reported by The Sunday Times, Kensington Palace says it will no longer share details on what the royal wears to official appearances. “She wants the focus to be on the really important issues, the people and the causes she is spotlighting,” a palace source told the paper. “There will always be an appreciation of what the princess is wearing from some of the public and she gets that. But do we need to be officially always saying what she is wearing? No.” A palace spokesperson has since refuted that. “Over the last week, I have received numerous questions about a story regarding The Princess of Wales’s clothing and how Kensington Palace shares information about her outfits,” said a statement from a palace representative. “To clarify, the comments that appeared in the article were from me, not The Princess of Wales.” “The comments that were reported should not be directly attributed to The Princess of Wales,” the statement continued. “To be clear, there has been no change in our approach to sharing information about Her Royal Highness’s clothing.” Whatever the case, Kate’s focus on mindful dressing means we won’t have to ponder too long.

Timothée Chalamet Wears Florals With a Twist for Date Night,https://www.vogue.com/article/timothee-chalamet-floral-shirt-date-night,"February 12, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Florals, for Valentine’s? Not very groundbreaking, but when it’s a Prada bouquet print in highlighter green on Timothée Chalamet? Romance! Yesterday (February 11), Chalamet attended the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, where he was being honored with the Arlington Artist Of The Year Award for his roles in A Complete Unknown and Dune: Part Two. Girlfriend Kylie Jenner was present to support, making the evening into a date night for the pair. Chalamet’s cotton shirt features a lively floral scene in lime green, yellow and white, taken from Prada’s archive of prints, with tapered cuffs and a collar, finished with mother of pearl buttons. Styled by Taylor McNeill, Chalamet wore a grass green tank top underneath, a silver chain, loose faded denim jeans (forgoing the bootcut shape originally meant for him, that McNeill put on Kendrick Lamar for his Super Bowl performance), and his favorite white sneakers. The mustache, too, lives on, and he’s trimmed his hair into more of a pixie cut. Chalamet also took to the stage for a conversation with Dune co-star Josh Brolin. Date night style varies for Chalamet and Jenner, following more their own individual style codes rather than the sartorial contours of their respective partner. When they were photographed out for dinner in Paris, Chalamet wore Chanel fresh from the A Complete Unknown premiere. His current wardrobe consists of Martine Rose and an array of small New York designers in a nod to his home city. Jenner opts for her own label KHY, Chanel tweed, and bombshell silhouettes. Timothée Chalamet’s awards campaign wardrobe has been somewhat chaotic, cycling through Bob Dylan method dressing, smart vintage picks, and pal Haider Ackermann’s iteration of Celine—with a continued allegiance to the skinny scarf trend. This romantic Prada feels, at least, on theme. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.
