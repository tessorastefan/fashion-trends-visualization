The Best Vintage Stores in São Paulo,Sustainable Fashion,"Vogue’s guide to the best vintage stores in São Paulo is part of our directory of the very best vintage around the world, curated by editors from all over. Whether you’re traveling and searching for some superb stores to visit on your trip or are curious about your local vintage treasure chests, Vogue’s directory has you covered. Is vintage what you think about when you think of São Paulo? It very well should be! The city is leading the secondhand and archival scene in Brazil—and South America, for that matter—with a handful of stores that satisfy a variety of vintage flights of fancy. For those looking for an emporium of theatrical vintage fashion, there is a store for that (head to Casa Juisi). If you’re less interested in older fashion and looking for more recent designer labels, there are plenty of superb options for that too (see Pretty New and Take Me Vintage.) If you enjoy the hunt and sifting through boutiques that offer a combination of the two, then Frou Frou is the store for you. It’s a fashionable choose-your-own-adventure, and to help you narrow it down, we’ve compiled a list of the best vintage stores in São Paulo, curated with the help of our editors at Vogue Brazil. Founded in 2007 by Paula Rondon and Gil França, B. Luxo is stocked with vintage pieces collected from around the world. It is a destination for no-label vintage, predominantly from the ’60s, ’70s, and ’80s. Inside the store, there are wunderkammers filled with antique jewelry, glass bell jars containing vintage accessories, and a fair amount of taxidermy birds adding to the fashion cabinet-of-curiosity vibes. The mood carries over online, where a superb selection of their wares is listed for sale. Address: R. Augusta, 2294 - Sala 22 - Cerqueira César, São Paulo - SP, 01412-100 Introducing Casa Juisi, a São Paulo institution that has long lured fashion history buffs and vintage enthusiasts to the city’s center. Here, you’ll find archival gems like Moschino’s silverware-laden jacket from 1989 and nautical ’80s fashions by Zandra Rhodes, but also American marching band costumes, theatrical opera gowns, and more. It’s a hodgepodge assortment with a common denominator of fabulousness. Address: R. Roberto Simonsen, 108 - Sé, São Paulo - SP, 01017-020 Founded in 2007 by mother-and-daughter duo Luzia Belucci and Giovanna Belucci, Frou Frou Vintage is a collection of vintage and secondhand products they’ve sourced from around the globe. Its mission is to promote the second (and third!) lives of all their pieces through affordably priced pieces for sale or rent. Inside, you’ll find a delightful mix of styles—disco balls hang from the ceiling, Persian rugs line the floors, and hats fill up every available space on the walls. Assortment-wise, it’s half thrift store and half designer vintage; shop pieces from the ’70s, ’80s, ’90s, and ’00s by Courrèges, Prada, Glória Coelho, Huis Clos, Reinaldo Lourenço, Bottega Veneta, Cacharel, Comme des Garçons, and more. Address: R. Augusta, 725 - 2 - Consolação São Paulo - SP, 01305-100 This store’s name, Minha Avó Tinha (meaning “My Grandmother Had” in Portuguese), sums things up perfectly. This is not your label-laden vintage store but a collection of early 20th-century pieces that your grandmother just might have actually hand. This Art Deco jewelry, lace shirting, woolen A-line skirts, boxy-shouldered blazers. All of this is displayed alongside vintage decor and furniture that adds to the ambiance but is also for sale. It had all the charm of a thrift store but all the presentation (and organization!) of a high-end designer vintage salon. Address: R. Tomé de Souza, 100 - Lapa, São Paulo - SP, 05079-000 For secondhand designer fashion, New4another is a well-stocked boutique and e-boutique frequented by São Paulo’s fashion crowd. The store, which is decorated in shades of sage green, is pristinely organized with shoes, accessories, wallets, and clothing galore in excellent condition. You won't find vintage-vintage here but you will find a great, barely-worn Zimmermann dress you can wear to your next outing. Address: R. Campo Verde, 61 - Conj 72 - Jardim Europa São Paulo - SP, 01456-010 Colors! Texture! Mood! And we're not even talking about the clothes. Pretty New’s punchy boutique is a delight to visit. The HQ for a second-hand resale site is stocked with high-end labels—in this one corner, you'll clock Loewe, Balenciaga, Chanel, Veronica Beard, and more. Founded by Gabriella Constantino Leal in 2014, the store is curated with current-season trends, and there's even a never-worn but not new section. It's the next best thing—better?—to shopping firsthand fashion in SP. Address: Av. Nove de Julho, 4865 - Jardim Paulista, São Paulo - SP, 01407-200 Conveniently located in a shopping mall behind a nondescript wooden door (IYKYK), Take Me Vintage is a sprawling emporium for secondhand designer fashions. Shoppable in-store and online, Take Me Vintage is more designer-secondhand than vintage, but there are plenty of runway pieces and heirlooms in the making up for grabs. Clothing is organized by color and vibe, and the shoes playfully line the store, winding all the way up the sets to the upper floor. Address: Shopping Cidade Jardim Av. Magalhães de Castro, 12.000 - Cidade Jardim, São Paulo - SP, 05502-001 More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

A Moment For the Cool Model-Off-Duty Looks From NYFW,Streetwear,"The new fall 2025 collections, debuted during New York Fashion Week, were not the only exciting looks to take in this week. Off the catwalk, the street style scene put forward interesting new outfit propositions as well—be it via great coats, new It bags, or statement hosiery. And while this season’s crop of well-clad showgoers mostly consisted of celebrities, editors, and VIP influencers, the participating models—dashing from one show to the next—also delivered their own fashion flavor. This week’s shows served as a true hub for impeccable model-off-duty style, as there is something effortlessly cool about the way models put outfits together in between gigs. Sure, their own outfits often different drastically from the new designs they sport on the runway, but they sometimes strike similar notes of elegance and trendiness. Take model of the moment Alex Consani, who was spotted in an oversized cream sweater and slouchy leather boots, or runway regular Paloma Elsesser, who paired calf-length leggings with a cropped leather bomber. Other supermodels, like Kendall Jenner, opted for statement accessories to keep warm during the week—like a jaunty hat and scarf. While the looks were built for function and coziness while on-the-go—they were also perfect for the awaiting street style photographers crowing around pre-and-post show. This is NYFW, after all: one must be camera-ready at all times. In need of some winter style inspiration? Look no further than to the models who made the streets of New York their personal runway. Below, more of the best model-off-duty moments from NYFW. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

5 Ways to Style Hotel-Like Slippers for Everyday,Streetwear,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Few things communicate luxury quite like a well-appointed pair of hotel slippers. Designers are bringing that energy to the everyday with inspired slippers that are created for the streets. Miu Miu arguably started the trend last fall with a logo’ed leather pair that set the tone and The Row has made the slipper one of its house codes, most often paired with louche silhouettes in neutral tones. Consider the slipper the less feminine take on last spring’s fixation on the ballerina, primed to be paired with maxi dresses and easy trousers with tanks as the weather warms up. Surprisingly versatile, you can style yours with denim for weekend wear, suiting for the office, and nearly every occasion in between. From sleek satin pairs by The Row and Loro Piana, to fur-lined Toteme slippers, and leather styles from Proenza Schouler and Bottega Veneta, the options are nearly endless—and wildly comfortable. Pair them with socks now for warmth or wear them solo come spring, simply slide into the slipper look and thank us later. Embrace the anorak trend—but make it extra elegant by pairing yours with a poplin midi and elevated accessories. A satin slipper is the ideal shoe to keep the whole thing sleek but still perfectly casual.

Doechii Knows Her 2025 Grammys Looks Demanded “A Certain Taste Level”,Red Carpet,"“Class is in session!” Last night, Doechii became the third woman to take home the Grammy award for Best Rap Album for Alligator Bites Never Heal. A lifelong student of hip-hop, the Swamp Princess paid homage to Jay-Z’s fondness for suiting in her Thom Browne looks. “I love telling a fashion story and that’s what we plan on doing at the Grammys,” Doechii told Vogue three days ahead of her award-winning night. And that she did. The newly minted Grammy winner wore not one but four custom Thom Browne looks for her banner night. Doechii on the red carpet at the 2025 Grammys. Accepting the Grammy for Best Rap Album. But just because she embraced the masculine elements of suiting and hip-hop culture doesn’t mean she abandoned the feminine. While she was torn on the red carpet look, Doechii settled on a off-the-shoulder gray pinstripe dress with corseting detail down the back, which she wore over a white Oxford shirt with Browne’s signature red, white, and blue armband. “I think that this is sleek and simple and to the point,” she says. “It tells a story and it’s direct.” Performing. Performing. After the Grammys. Luckily, the other look came in handy when accepting her Grammy. Doechii chose a high-waisted pannier trouser with a raglan sleeve jacket, which she loved for “the drama of it all.” “You have to have a certain taste level and an eye to immediately understand it,” she says. And that’s not to say anything of the other looks she pulled out… Watch as Doechii takes us along for her final fitting with Thom Browne ahead of the 2025 Grammys, and below see the behind-the-scenes of her Grammy-winning night.

How to Wash Cashmere for Long-Lasting Elegance,Sustainable Fashion,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. We know that cashmere can have a large environmental impact—which is why it’s extra important that we look after our luxurious knits to ensure they stand the test of time. But how exactly should we be washing our cashmere? And what are the best ways to look after our jumpers long-term? Below, Vogue speaks to the experts for their top tips on how to wash and care for our cashmere. While many of us are nervous about machine washing cashmere, lest it shrinks, Oyuna Tserendorj, founder of London-based cashmere brand Oyuna, says that we don’t need to be. “Cashmere can definitely be washed in a washing machine on a wool setting at 30 degrees,” she says, although she suggests that you don’t put your most expensive cashmere pieces in the wash right away. “If you’re new to machine washing cashmere, test with a less precious item first, as washing machine settings can vary.” Instead of using regular detergent, Tserendorj uses her own organic shampoo, noting that you don’t need to buy special cashmere products. For those who still aren’t sure about machine washing, hand washing is of course an option. “I tend to soak the piece in warm water with a bit of detergent and gently hand wash, then refill the sink with clear water to rinse,” says Johnstons of Elgin CEO Chris Gaffney, who likes to use Clothes Doctor’s cashmere and wool detergent. “I then pop the piece into the machine on a spin cycle to take out most of the moisture, but this can also be done by gently wringing the water out.” When it comes to drying your cashmere, make sure you shape it first. While Tserendorj leaves her cashmere pieces on a drying rack, Gaffney likes to lie his flat on a towel, adding: “You don’t want to leave it lying out of shape soaking wet for too long, and I would never tumble dry.” Another dilemma is whether to hand wash or dry clean our cashmere. Gaffney says that washing can actually increase the softness of our cashmere garments over their lifetime. However, he notes that “woven fabric needs to be dry cleaned,” while dry cleaning is also recommended “for some special heavier pieces, or very fine yarns.” If in doubt, it’s best to check the care label. This is down to personal preference: some experts say twice a season, while others suggest every three or four wears. The bottom line? You probably don’t need to wash your cashmere as much as you think you do. “Cashmere is a natural fibre, so it loves sunlight and fresh air,” Tserendorj says. “Place it outside, or on a warm radiator, to freshen up in the winter.” While most cashmere will pill to some degree, it’s less likely to be an issue with better-quality garments, “as longer cashmere fibres are used in better garments, and the quality of yarn spinning and knitting tension help too,” Gaffney explains. “Generally pilling will reduce over time as the shorter fibres come out.” To tackle any bobbly bits, you can use lint rollers or even shavers, although Gaffney recommends a specialist cashmere comb. To ensure your cashmere lasts, it’s of course crucial to store your pieces properly to keep the moths at bay. Before putting them away, Tserendorj recommends washing to remove any food remnants or strong perfume from your garments. “Then put away in a cloth bag, ideally with a cedar block,” the expert continues. “If you discover moths, put your garment in the freezer for 48 hours, which should kill the moths, and then wash as above and store away.” More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

Nicole Kidman Is So Babygirl’s Samuel in Her 2025 Critics Choice Awards Look,Red Carpet,"While the 30th annual Critics Choice Awards 2025 was a more muted affair this year, with attendees’ fashion choices leaning more into darker tones and simple silhouettes, there remained some dynamic moments. One being Nicole Kidman: the star of Babygirl decided to channel her co-star Harris Dickinson’s character Samuel in a structured blazer and pleated greige pants from Saint Laurent spring 2025. Kidman wore her voluminous blonde hair parted in the middle with subtle but well-defined waves. Nicole Kidman at the Critics Choice Awards 2025. Diverging from the Saint Laurent runway styling, Kidman wore the suit with a pale blue shirt and navy blue tie with white polka dots. Very important day in the big office vibe. For footwear, she wore black pointed pumps. The angular silhouette of the jacket, juxtaposed with the more fluid pants, reflected an assured sense of corporate power. And it makes total sense, then, when you consider the Saint Laurent spring 2025 foundations. “My last men’s show in March had been all about tailoring, but based on flou; I wanted this one to be the opposite—more strict,” Anthony Vaccarello of Saint Laurent said of the collection Kidman’s suit comes from. “It’s not about when I would do a tuxedo for a woman which was worn naked underneath. The suits come with shirts, ties. You’re dressed. It’s about control, and power, in a way.” While the look definitely channels more the energy of Kidman’s character’s sexual fantasy rather than company intern vibe, it also reflects the enduring power of the suit on this current awards season circuit. Case en point: Ayo Edebiri’s expert referencing of the Julia Roberts moment with markedly masculine tailoring at the 2025 Golden Globes. Ayo Edebiri at the Golden Globes 2025. Julia Roberts at the 1990 Golden Globes. Kidman was nominated not for Babygirl, but for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her work in Special Ops: Lioness for the Critics Choice Awards. Of course, Nicole Kidman knows how to wear a suit in both subversive and elevated ways: who could forget the glitzy gray Michael Kors pinstriped jumpsuit that recalled her iconic AMC ad. A look that was later auctioned off at Sotheby’s, and became a go-to Halloween costume, too. It’s in suiting that Kidman holds the power.

Allow Zoë Kravitz to Introduce the Winter Sandal,Streetwear,"The snow from this week’s storm hasn’t even melted in New York City, but that didn’t stop Zoë Kravitz from breaking out her summer sandals. The actor and director arrived at Danielle Haim’s birthday party alongside Cara Delevingne and her Big Little Lies costar Shailene Woodley. While all of them bundled up for the blustery weather, Kravitz wasn’t going to let the cold stop her sartorial vision. She styled a pair of black leather kitten heeled ankle strap sandals with low-denier black tights. The open-toed shoe in freezing temps wasn’t the only so-called “fashion rule” that Kravitz broke last night. She bundled up in a calf-length black coat, which she paired with a navy blue fringed scarf. While the notion that one can’t wear black and navy together is outdated, here it serves as a reminder that Kravitz is wont to do what she pleases—rules (and snow) be damned. The actor finished off her look with a simple black leather envelope bag from Saint Laurent complete with a gold crossbody chain, which she matched to her smattering of gold jewelry. Amidst a sea of partygoers in wild outfits galore, Zoë Kravitz reminded us that sometimes breaking the rules can be a quiet act.

Meghan Markle Sports Her Go-To Coat Brand at the 2025 Invictus Games,Red Carpet,"Every year, it is tradition for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to attend the annual Invictus Games in Vancouver, Canada. Prince Harry is a patron for the organization, after all, and he and the Duchess of Sussex have been steady supporters of the games for years—a multi-sport event held for wounded, injured, and sick military service personnel. Yesterday, the 2025 Games kicked off in the city, and the royal couple were once again on-hand in the crowd to witness the official kickoff ceremony. Naturally, Markle brought a polished and elegant look to the affair, and kept warm by choosing one of her go-to coat brands. The Duchess opted for an ivory double-breasted trench coat from Sentaler, a Canadian luxury outerwear brand that she has worn plenty of styles from over the years. Her latest? A refined alpaca and wool coat, finished off with corozo buttons, and that retails for $2,290. She styled it minimally, with a black knit dress that allowed her outerwear to be the focal point. The Duchess of Sussex has proven to be a fan (and repeat wearer) of Sentaler’s sleek and minimal coats over the years. Markle has worn the brand’s camel coats and bright red power coats, both discreet to statement styles. And by choosing a Canadian label for a Canadian-bred event, she clearly wanted to pay tribute to the homegrown talent in the country—a thoughtful and royal touch by Meghan Markle, and not to mention, an extremely chic one.

15 Archive Photos of Original Rock Chick Marianne Faithfull,Streetwear,"Marianne Faithfull’s Swinging London wardrobe was as treasured as her music. The 1960s icon—who died on Thursday at age 78, according to a spokespesron—carved out a stellar career with hits like “As Tears Go By” and “The Ballad of Lucy Jordan,” not to mention her memorable performance in Jack Cardiff’s The Girl on a Motorcycle (1968). But it’s her innate sense of style she was perhaps most famous for. From silk neck scarves to knee-high leather boots and oversized collars, the singer set the sartorial tone for the decade while sidelining flower-power fashion. Whether in a leather jumpsuit or a colorful velvet suit, Faithfull set the stage alight, her blunt fringe becoming as legendary as her four-year romance with Rolling Stone Mick Jagger. In celebration of her life, below we take a closer look at one of Britain’s longest-reigning style muses. In a cuffed minidress, she poses for a portrait with her pet Dalmatian. In her go-to paisley patterned shirt, she hangs off a ladder in London for a promo shot. For her TV appearance on Thank Your Lucky Stars, she opted for a monochrome dress and classic black pumps. She liked to add a French-girl touch to outfits in the form of a silk neck scarf. Standing outside London’s National Film Theatre (now BFI Southbank), she looked every inch the star with a jacket shrugged over her shoulders and patent Mary Janes on her feet.

"Hailey Bieber Revives the Babushka Scarf Trend, Because Needs Must",Streetwear,"It hasn’t been long since Hailey Bieber has returned from the fashion-off that was Aspen, where she spent the start of 2025 après-skiing and hitting the slopes with husband Justin Bieber, cozying up in sumptuous faux fur with Kendall and Kylie Jenner, and heading out for dinner pantsless. But Bieber is back in New York and very much back to work promoting her new Rhode lip product. Stepping out in the city yesterday (January 29), Bieber made the dash through Union Square in a functional yet fashionable fit. She kept to neutral tones and some signature pieces, wearing an oversized beige trench and matching low-rise suit trousers, with a grey button-up cardigan and white t-shirt underneath. She also wore her go-to black penny loafers, a chocolate brown shoulder bag and sunglasses, and chose a grey cashmere scarf to wrap around her shoulders. But needs must when you’re battling that New York chill: As the weather got stormier, Bieber revealed her shoulder-draping scarf to be a bonnet. Babushka Bieber has arrived—though it’s probably more a sartorial decision to lean into the old Hollywood glamor aesthetic of the headgear, a la Audrey Hepburn or Louise Brooks. Celebrities from Kendall Jenner, to Chloë Sevigny and Marc Jacobs are also purveyors of the bonnet. Bieber keeps her winter wardrobe winning. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

Why Demi Moore’s Custom McQueen Gown at the 2025 BAFTAs Was a Perfect Choice,Red Carpet,"Creative director Seán McGirr recently told British Vogue that he wants his Alexander McQueen to be about youthful energy and “the animal within.” Which makes the Irish designer’s work a particularly apposite choice for Demi Moore, star of The Substance, in which a younger version of her character, Elisabeth Sparkle, literally bursts forth from her flesh in scenes gorier than any wildlife documentary. Moore, who is in the running for the Leading Actress BAFTA for her performance in the film, arrived at the 2025 ceremony tonight wearing a glittering halter-neck gown, featuring a graphic design. Evidently a fan of McGirr’s work, the star previously wore a shimmering black gown from his spring 2025 Alexander McQueen collection on the red carpet back in November. Demi has emerged as the toast of awards season, having already scooped a Golden Globe last month, her first major win (indeed her first nomination, as she noted in her acceptance speech) in some 45 years in the movie business. An emotional Moore, who described how she’d gotten used to being written off as a “popcorn actress” despite having one of the most enduring careers in Hollywood, told the crowd on the night that she was celebrating “being reminded that I do belong.” If she’s had to wait a while for recognition from her peers, Demi, who collected that Golden Globe in a shimmering strapless Armani Privé gown, has never been short of fashion plaudits. While she was crafting her own looks for her earliest red carpet appearances, at 62 she’s a regular on the front row (frequently accompanied by her almost equally feted pet dog, Pilaf), and she’s been known to appear on the runway, too. When Kim Jones was preparing to unveil his debut Fendi Haute Couture collection at the Palais Brongniart back in 2021, he cast supermodels Kate Moss, Christy Turlington and Naomi Campbell, but it was Demi he tasked with opening the show.

Gen Z Deserves an Hervé Léger Bandage Dress Revival,High Fashion,"When Kaia Gerber attended the Toronto International Film Festival premiere of her film Shell, she sought out a designer who isn’t as common on the red carpet nowadays: Hervé Léger. The model wore a white full-length bandage dress, a recreation of her mother Cindy Crawford’s 1993 Oscars look. “Kaia had sent me a mood board for TIFF and this was one of her references,” Molly Dickson, who styled Gerber for the event, told Vogue. While Gerber was paying homage to her supermodel mom, it did give the label a moment in the sun for a new generation. Even for the eldest Gen Z-ers, the French brand’s trademark bodycon silhouette felt out of reach, falling out of fashion before we reached an appropriate age to wear them. “Hervé Léger is the ’90s supermodel second-skin,” Liana Satenstein, host of Neverworns and former Vogue writer says of the dress’s appeal. And, as she wrote in 2022, “an Hervé bandage dress acts as a bra for your whole body—holding you perfectly in place.” Rihanna at the 2007 Clive Davis Pre-Grammys Party. Blake Lively as Serena van der Woodsen on Gossip Girl, 2009. The dress persisted beyond the ’90s supermodel era, reaching the early days of Kardashian fame, teen soap operas, and Transformer movies. As my Millennial colleagues regale the Gen Z staffers with tales about hitting the club in a form-fitting Hervé Léger number, I can’t help but feel a pang of FOMO. But beyond Gerber, it seems that the younger generation is bandage dress-curious. On TikTok, young people who missed the boat last time around are creating a new wave of interest. One video with over 116,000 likes reads, “pov: your [sic] born in 2001 but now your [sic] old enough to own a herve leger dress.” Another proclaimed she was “feeling soooo serena van der woodsen,” referring to a dress that Blake Lively wore on Gossip Girl. With a cycle of nostalgia-driven trends, it’s no surprise that the bandage dress would reincarnate. “Today, there is an overwhelming sensual mood in the air and a thirst for going out,” Satenstein says. During a recent live shopping installment of Neverworns, she included a rainbow gradient dress with white piping by Léger, which she says “felt right for the world.” It was purchased before the evening was over. My colleague Margaux Anbouba, Vogue’s senior beauty and wellness editor, told me of her bandage dress days, “Hervé Léger saw me through some of my brightest and boldest moments of the aughts. At the time, I don’t think I had ever felt more powerful than when I put on a bandage dress—the sucked in sausage casing effect was perfect for my favorite pastime of that era, dancing in the club.” May the members of Gen Z get to experience that same joy that only a bandage dress can provide.

Forget the Naked Dress—Jennie Brings a Naked Cape to Couture Week,High Fashion,"Is there a more star-studded show during couture week than Chanel? Arguable! Every season, the French label draws an A-list crowd of attendees, and this morning’s presentation at the Grand Palais was certainly no different. Celebrities in the front row included Dua Lipa, Lily Rose-Depp, Kylie Jenner, Pamela Anderson, and Jennie—talk about a VIP crowd! Of course, each star was sure to slip into their finest Chanel looks for the occasion (couture week is all about extravagance, after all). However, it was Jennie who stole the show with her chic powder-blue cape and trousers styling. And her daring look nodded to one of the biggest fashion movements of the moment. Over the past year, the naked dress—silhouettes that are totally sheer, exposing the form underneath–have taken over the red carpets. Celebrities have been unafraid to show some skin, and Jennie’s styling of the cape—worn without a top underneath, safe for a tasteful body chain—nodded to the trend in an elegant way, especially when styled with black dress pants. Clearly, the naked trend is not leaving us anytime soon, but Jennie’s elevated treatment of the look shows promise for a 2025 evolution. Perhaps this year will be less about the all-exposing gown, and more about giving structured pieces—jackets, capes, blazers—a sexier spin by forgoing a shirt with them. Prepare yourself for the fashion movement, because when Jennie embraces something, it usually takes off rather quickly. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

In Perfect Step: A Maison Margiela and Christian Louboutin Collaboration Inspired By One Magical Collection,High Fashion,"Christian Louboutin first remembers John Galliano 40 years ago, making his first, tentative steps in Paris, the city of dreams, the city of fashion. “He was an excited English fashion student, but also very, very excited by Paris,” Louboutin recalls, “He was always saying, ‘I love Paris, and Paris loves me!’ And Paris really loved him.” John Galliano had rather despaired of his London life. The ’80s had been a glorious, carefree, wild decade, but those heady days were coming to an end. AIDS was rearing its terrible head, and heroin cast a pall. Fashion in London was tough. His backers withdrew their support. But Galliano knew that in Paris his fantasies would somehow become realities. There, he slept on friends’ sofas and ate beans on toast as he chased this elusive dream. Louboutin recalls that “he was a very joyful, happy person.” Galliano was swept up in the Paris world. And it treated him royally, for a time. But in spite of this love and their friendship, Louboutin and Galliano had never collaborated in a serious way before on a collection. Of course they had collaborated on individual models for specific clients (for instance, Louboutin did the shoes for Kate Moss’s 2011 wedding—the dress, a memorably 1930s fairy tale by John Galliano for Margiela). The Maison Margiela x Christian Louboutin collaboration. That is, until “one day I had lunch with John and Alexis [Roche, his partner], and he said, out of the blue, ‘Would you consider doing something with me?’ And immediately I said ‘Yes of course!’ John was very, very happy. And suddenly he was a shower of ideas. This was a milestone in his story because he was so, so, so, into it. He was drowned by it, and so excited and so precise, and so full of his creative energy.” Galliano “always loved shoes but he’s never made them,” as Louboutin explains, so he has assembled key figures who have brought their skills to the medium, “and I’m very happy and proud to be one of them,” adds Louboutin. “You know, it’s funny when you work. We worked almost a year ahead, and it was very complicated—because his clothes are incredibly complicated to do because of the faux cul [the false bottom] and so on. Everything was on a level of couture that is almost never reached.” Ultimately, the show was a triumph; a swansong for John Galliano’s extraordinary decade at Maison Margiela. “It was of a perfection,” says Louboutin, “that evening, with the drizzle under the bridge.” The show was held under the Pont Alexandre III bridge in Paris, where Galliano had conjured a sort of thread bare 1930s boite. It was a Brassai moment, with Pat McGrath’s extraordinary second skin, shining face masks. “Even if I was expecting something which was going to be great, I was not necessarily ready to have such a vision of such an impactful show. It’s one thing that you can expect from very, very few designers, and you can expect this from him,” says Louboutin. “The level of emotion involved in the show, not only in the clothes, but in the show itself: it was a really magical moment. You know, it's poetry and magic. Even just talking about it makes me emotional! It took 40 years of John Galliano to make me cry at a show,” remembers Louboutin. “…And the shoes!” So now, taking a deep breath after the show of shows, Louboutin has worked on a second collection for Maison Margiela, the silhouettes drawn from the show. They have outlined a few stores, “So they will be sold at Margiela and they will be sold at Louboutin!” he exults. “Ever since I've known John,” Louboutin continues, “he has a kind of passion for tribal clothes, [clothes] from plays, from dance, from Kabuki. His brain is built boiling around that anyway.” A look from the Maison Margiela spring 2024 couture—and Louboutin’s high heeled version of the Tabi. There are outrageous high heels, and foot-to-the-ground flats, all with the Tabi, the toe separator, off setting the glamour of the Louboutins. (Although it’s made in a whole new way, more couture and less homespun than the Margiela originals). There are also wedding shoes, with a twist. “The idea was almost like a game to play with the codes of two houses, Margiela and Louboutin. With Margiela you have deconstruction. I would call it ‘creative minimalism’ for Margiela. And for my DNA, it is almost a classical vision of femininity, a sexy femininity. So basically, for me to bring Margiela into my world."" So in a white high-heeled Tabi shoe with a streak of red paint down the heel, one can see the worlds of Margiela and Louboutin colliding. “I think it's probably the perfect marriage!” laughs Louboutin.

27 of Rihanna’s Boldest Style Moments Throughout the Years,Red Carpet,"As far as fashion is concerned, Rihanna has always been ahead of the curve—able to dabble in trends in a genuinely fearless manner. Risk-taking is central to her style influence, and what better time to revisit her epic wardrobe than today, on her 37th birthday? Off-duty, Rihanna is a true fashion girl. By day, she's in tracksuit-stiletto combos, gargantuan puffer jackets, and killer thigh-high boots. By night, she’s often wearing similarly casual gear, with the added touch of some vintage jewelry (or lots of diamonds) and a designer coat. Uniting her day-to-night dressing? A sense of fun and excitement: Don’t ever expect the star to wear discrete everyday basics. Rih’s red carpet looks command attention, too, though. In the noughties, she rocked low-rise trousers, crop tops, and plentiful diamanté. In 2015, she made headlines with a sunshine-yellow Guo Pei gown at the Met Gala, and her 2017 Comme des Garçons dress and 2018 John Galliano headpiece also broke the internet. More recently, she attended the Fashion Awards in London—with A$AP Rocky by her side—sporting a a Christian Lacroix fall 2002 couture mini dress with the matching oversized fuzzy hat, naturally. In honor of her birthday, revisit Rihanna’s most head-turning looks, below. Rih was one of the first out the gate in Saint Laurent’s fuzzy heart coat back in 2016, shown at the maison’s fall 2016 showcase. Many stars have braved the naked dress—Rihanna included. She commanded attention in a sparkling Swarovski crystal-encrusted look by Adam Selman at the CFDA Awards in 2014. Comme des Garçons was behind the eccentric look that she wore to the Met Gala in 2017. The vibrant gown that she wore to the Met Gala in 2015 will go down in history as one of the best looks the event has ever witnessed. Rihanna attended her Diamond Ball—a bash that she throws every year—wearing Alexis Mabille couture and Chopard jewels in 2018. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

How To Get Rid Of Clothes Moths And Protect Your Wardrobe,Sustainable Fashion,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Moth-proofing your wardrobe is essential, if you don’t want the insects feeding on your most expensive cashmere knits and silk dresses. Clothes moths kill your investment pieces, and completely negates that big closet clean-out you did. While moth season tends to run from April to May, and then again from August to September, it’s become an issue throughout the U.S., thanks to rising temperatures. Not sure where to begin? Below, see Vogue’s top tips for preventing a moth infestation in your wardrobe—and how to tackle one if it’s already too late. Moths tend to be attracted to natural fibers like cashmere, silk, lambswool, shearling, and cotton because they feed on the protein keratin, the building block of these materials. Given that keratin also helps form human hair, skin, and nails, it’s crucial that you ensure your clothes are clean before you stow them away in your wardrobe. If you see a moth flying around your home, don’t fear. It’s not necessarily a clothes moth. The two main types that feed on your clothes in the United States—the webbing clothes moth (Tineola bisselliella) and the casemaking clothes moth (Tinea pellionella)—are small and difficult to see. The webbing clothes moth is identifiable from its golden color and around half an inch in length, while the casemaking clothes moth is pale, silvery gray-brown with dark spots, and fringed, hairy wings. Most people realize clothes moths have invaded their wardrobes when they see small holes in their knitwear or silk dresses. One option is to keep Pheromone super sticky glue traps, which attract the male moths, therefore removing them from the reproduction cycle, in your wardrobe or around your home. They also act as an indicator as to whether you have moths, or you can also use a moth box to monitor for a possible infestation. Moths eggs are tiny—usually between 0.5 to 1.5 millimeters in size—making them extremely difficult to see, but you might spot the webbing that larvae leave behind on your clothes. The life cycle of a moth is 65 to 90 days, with female moths laying up to 300 eggs each. This means your small moth problem can very quickly escalate. It’s the larvae that feast on natural fibers, not the adult moths which don’t actually have the ability to eat. Eggs will hatch after anything between four days and three weeks—in summer this process is faster than in winter. Yes—however it requires real commitment and dedication (and sometimes professional help) to get on top of an infestation. Once you have managed to do so, the key is to keep following the below steps to safeguard your wardrobe against clothes moths and prevent further infestations from happening again and again. Moths can enter your home through cracks, windows, and on new items of clothing, so just because you have got on top of your problem doesn’t mean they won’t return. Moths like undisturbed corners that are dark and warm. Remove everything from your wardrobe, vacuum all the corners and drawers, and wipe all your surfaces with a detergent-soaked cloth to kill off larvae. Then wash all of your clothes (and curtains and upholstery, too). Dry cleaning kills moth eggs and larvae, and is an excellent option for bulky items like coats. Freeze anything you can fit on your freezer shelves; sub-zero temperatures kill larvae, although make sure you put clothes in plastic bags prior to freezing to avoid a condensation build-up. Keep them in there for at least 48 hours, or up to a week if you can. Heat also kills larvae and eggs, however, hot temperatures can damage cashmere. To ensure you’ve got rid of all the larvae and eggs, Total Wardrobe Care’s Julia Dee explains that you can start by “applying natural moth-killing products, such as chrysanthemum-based sprays.” This will prevent any more moths hatching, so you don’t go back to square one. A moth infestation can cause thousands of pounds worth of damage depending on the clothes you have in your wardrobe, and so bringing in the professionals to fumigate your house if the problem is significant is often worth the investment. Moths love to feast on human sweat, food particles, and stains. Do not put any clothes back in your newly cleaned wardrobe that are dirty—especially knitwear or natural fibers. As well as laundering your clothes, ensure that your wardrobe and drawers are also clean. “Regularly wipe down surfaces with soapy water and thoroughly vacuum cracks and crevices to remove any larvae or eggs,” Dee recommends. Moths hate light and movement, so this can also help disturb them. Always store winter knits, coats, and any other items you particularly value in zipped garment bags (like knitwear and cashmere bags), and line the bags with anti-moth paper strips. Line your drawers in anti-moth paper, and deploy cedarwood blocks. Vintage clothes should always be dry cleaned or put in the freezer before being introduced to your wardrobe, as they are often the source of infestations. Moths hate them, and they’ll keep the shoulders on your dresses and jackets neat, too. Always take your clothes out of the plastic hanging bags from the dry cleaner. The plastic attracts dust, and the dust attracts moths. Keep checking your clothes for moth holes, keep rooms well-ventilated as temperatures start to rise, and keep a natural oil diffuser in your wardrobe at all times—it smells great and wards off moths. Moth cassettes are also a good precautionary measure, and you can keep them hanging on your rail at all times. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Victoria Beckham’s Transparent Heels Come With a Medical Warning,High Fashion,"Brave is the woman in a transparent heel bearing the human foot in all its anatomical nakedness. These are difficult shoes to make work (a sort of non-item anchoring an outfit to nothing), which, as anyone who lived through 2016 knows, will also function as a terrarium, in which varying bacteria flourish no matter the podiatric preening involved beforehand. There are few people willing to let their dogs out in public, and even fewer of us who want to see them collecting condensation in the process. And yet Victoria Beckham looked good in the ones she wore to the launch of David’s Boss campaign last night: a pair of her own spring 2025 iterations, crafted from PVC and attached to a lucite Cinderella heel, which she styled with a knitted skirt set just gauzy enough to hint at full-body impropriety. The designer’s been wearing several versions of this less-is-more stiletto for a while, sidestepping her reliable Balenciaga pantaboots for Alaïa’s Cœur pumps at Paris Fashion Week and Saint Laurent’s Chica slingbacks to lecture the students of Condé Nast College. But a warning to those who are thinking of following suit: “The foot by itself [without a sock] in a shoe, plastic or not, provides a perfect milieu for fungal growth,” Dr. Rock Positano, director of the non-surgical foot and ankle service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, told Vogue’s Liana Satenstein back in 2018. “It is moist, dark and there is heat. The combination of those three things make a foot inside a shoe a dangerous place.” Isn’t danger just another way of saying… “temptation?” Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

Timothée Chalamet Wears Florals With a Twist for Date Night,Streetwear,"Florals, for Valentine’s? Not very groundbreaking, but when it’s a Prada bouquet print in highlighter green on Timothée Chalamet? Romance! Yesterday (February 11), Chalamet attended the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, where he was being honored with the Arlington Artist Of The Year Award for his roles in A Complete Unknown and Dune: Part Two. Girlfriend Kylie Jenner was present to support, making the evening into a date night for the pair. Chalamet’s cotton shirt features a lively floral scene in lime green, yellow and white, taken from Prada’s archive of prints, with tapered cuffs and a collar, finished with mother of pearl buttons. Styled by Taylor McNeill, Chalamet wore a grass green tank top underneath, a silver chain, loose faded denim jeans (forgoing the bootcut shape originally meant for him, that McNeill put on Kendrick Lamar for his Super Bowl performance), and his favorite white sneakers. The mustache, too, lives on, and he’s trimmed his hair into more of a pixie cut. Chalamet also took to the stage for a conversation with Dune co-star Josh Brolin. Date night style varies for Chalamet and Jenner, following more their own individual style codes rather than the sartorial contours of their respective partner. When they were photographed out for dinner in Paris, Chalamet wore Chanel fresh from the A Complete Unknown premiere. His current wardrobe consists of Martine Rose and an array of small New York designers in a nod to his home city. Jenner opts for her own label KHY, Chanel tweed, and bombshell silhouettes. Timothée Chalamet’s awards campaign wardrobe has been somewhat chaotic, cycling through Bob Dylan method dressing, smart vintage picks, and pal Haider Ackermann’s iteration of Celine—with a continued allegiance to the skinny scarf trend. This romantic Prada feels, at least, on theme. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

“Les Siciliennes Are Going to Paris”—Inside Dolce & Gabbana’s Impromptu Alta Moda Show,High Fashion,"Fresh of the opening of their exhibition Du Coeur à la Main—which traces the magnificence of 10 years of their Alta Moda creations in the salons of the Grand Palais —Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce staged a défilé on the eve of couture week in Paris. It served as a sort of crowning touch, much like the finishing flourish on a Sicilian cassata, the traditional cake with icing that mirrors the pastel swirls of Palermo’s Baroque palazzos. “Les Siciliennes are going to Paris,” the designers said during a preview. By the opulent standards of their Dolce & Gabbana Alta Moda presentations—which typically involve several days of extravagant guest entertaining in Italian locations—the show was a more pared-down affair. Yet, held in the lavishly restored Hôtel de la Marine, it still highlighted their impressive range, offering a tour-de-force exploration of the many dimensions of their fétiche color—black. The enigmatic mystique of Sicilian culture lies at the heart of Stefano and Domenico’s oeuvre. The sacred and the profane, religious devotion and sensuality, simmering passion shrouded in a veil of composure and silence —these dramatic contrasts have shaped their repertoire from the outset, nearly 40 years ago. “We wanted to bring the authentic essence of who we are to Paris, the love for our homeland that is central to our work,” they explained. Quintessentially Italian, the show nonetheless read as their homage to La Ville Lumière and its haute couture tradition. “Showing here is a dream come true,” they shared. “We are deeply grateful and honored because we don’t see ourselves as couturiers, but as sarti, tailors with a passion for the beauty of the fatto a mano, the art of handmade craftsmanship. Sicily and Paris share a deep historical connection,” they explained. Although the French ruled the Kingdom of Sicily only briefly in the early 14th century, their influence left a lasting imprint on the region’s culture and way of life. Even today, traces of French can be found in the local dialect; the Palermitan aristocracy once spoke fluent French and frequently sent their chefs to Paris to master the art of haute cuisine. “To stand out against the unmatched Parisian flair for haute couture, the only option was to stay true to ourselves,” they reflected. And so, the Alta Moda Parigi collection was steeped in black as a counterpoint to the chic of the French capital: “Black is the ultimate symbol of Sicilian elegance, solemn yet extravagant, pure and alluring.” A “devotional procession from Palermo to the Ville Lumière,” the show unfolded as a reimagining of their most seductive best-ofs, embellished with intricate lace embroidery, encrustations, cut-outs, inlays, and Baroque golden appliqué, as well as boasting diverse silhouettes, from slender to sensuous to lavishly voluminous. It was a parade of somber black widows carrying rosaries and gold crosses pinned on cinched-waist belts, alluring femme fatales wrapped in embellished cocoons and theatrical capes, and coquettish ingénues, sporting corsets, lingerie, and fishnet stockings only barely veiled under sheer showstoppers. Attended mostly by devoted Dolce & Gabbana’s Alta Moda clients dressed to the nines in the designers’ latest creations, the show was followed by a lavish dinner at the Ritz, where Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, Catherine Deneuve, Eva Herzigova, and Monica Bellucci, with boyfriend Tim Burton in tow, fêted the designers, who cheerfully mingled late into the night.

Revisiting Kate Middleton’s BAFTA Gowns Through the Years,Red Carpet,"Rumour has it that Kate Middleton will be present and correct at this year’s BAFTAs, although Kensington Palace has yet to formally confirm her presence at Royal Festival Hall on the night. If the Princess of Wales does make her red carpet return, expect her look to be a relatively subdued one (and, most likely, a repeat wear) given her recent push to shift the public’s focus from her clothes to her work. The senior royal has, after all, been recycling gowns at black-tie events for years. Ahead of the ceremony on February 16, revisit all of her BAFTA appearances so far, below. For her most recent appearance at the BAFTAs, the Princess of Wales recycled her Alexander McQueen gown from the 2019 ceremony, pairing it with elbow-length gloves, an added chiffon sleeve, and a pair of Zara earrings. 2023 was a significant year for the awards, with the ceremony held at the Southbank Centre’s Royal Festival Hall for the first time. However, changes to the show format were overshadowed by a lack of progress regarding diversity on the night. The academy provided all guests at the 2020 BAFTAs—one of the last major events before the pandemic sent the world into lockdown—with a sustainable dressing guide courtesy of the London College of Fashion. The Duchess of Cambridge acknowledged the theme by dipping into her Alexander McQueen archive, choosing to rewear a dress from her 2012 tour of Southeast Asia in honor of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. A custom design by Sarah Burton, its cream fabric is overlaid with a hibiscus flower print—a nod to Malaysia’s national flower, as Kate first wore the dress to meet the country’s own royal family. In terms of jewelry, the Duchess selected a mother-of-pearl necklace and earrings from Van Cleef & Arpels’s Magic Alhambra collection for the night. For the 2019 BAFTAs, the Duchess of Cambridge selected a one-shouldered Alexander McQueen gown with floral embellishments. She had appeared in a similar dress in a rose colorway for the then Prince of Wales’s 70th birthday a few months earlier. It’s her jewelry, however, that predictably garnered headlines. Kate chose a pair of drop earrings inherited from Diana, Princess of Wales, featuring diamonds and South Sea pearls. Poignantly, the late royal wore the jewels to her last official engagement—a performance of Swan Lake at the Royal Albert Hall in 1997. The 2018 BAFTAs will be remembered as a watershed moment in the Me Too movement, with Sisters Uncut storming the red carpet to protest the terms of then Prime Minister Theresa May’s domestic violence and abuse bill. While the vast majority of female attendees wore black in a nod to Time’s Up, the Duchess of Cambridge opted for a politically neutral flowing dark-green gown by Jenny Packham, with a black sash tied above her pregnancy bump. She then accessorized her dress with a suite of emerald jewelry—emeralds being associated with hope and renewal, as well as the suffragette movement. For her 2017 BAFTAs debut, the Duchess of Cambridge turned again to Alexander McQueen, wearing a tiered off-the-shoulder gown embroidered with pale flowers—a custom take on a look from the brand’s spring 2016 resort collection—with diamond chandelier earrings. Kate later wore a variation on the same dress to an event at the National Portrait Gallery. Kate Middleton’s Wardrobe Spoke Volumes. What Will Happen Now That It’s Silenced?

Statement Tights—and Socks!—Were the Real MVP of NYFW,High Fashion,"The fall 2025 shows at New York Fashion Week officially close out tomorrow, and the street style set has been out in their finest attire all week long; lots of peacocking! In case you missed it, Vogue’s Phil Oh has been documenting the best statement outfits in and outside of the shows—capturing how VIPs are dressing for the snow and slush in style. While artful layering and great coats have been spotted aplenty, there is a more stealthy wardrobe staple that has emerged as the real fashion MVP: Let’s hear it for tights and socks. Sure, a bright-colored tight or frilly sock may not seem like an instant outfit-maker, but this week, the accessories have elevated the street style set’s sprightly outfits from good to great. An animal-print jacket with a bright teal tight? Fun! An orange coat with argyle knee-highs? Fresh! In addition to keeping folks warm, tights and socks have also added a dash of personality and whimsy to winter looks. And the bold approach to wearing hosiery isn’t just happening off the runways: On the catwalks themselves, New York Fashion Week labels got into the spirit, too. Sandy Liang showed polka-dotted leggings underneath frilly skirts, while Anna Sui paired striped knee socks with striped knit mini skirts. You knows it’s a real trend with legs (pun intended) when both the runways and the crowds at the shows are partaking in the look. Out is the idea that socks or tights should be purely utilized for function, in is the reality that they can infuse a look with wow factor. Anna Sui fall 2025 Sandy Liang fall 2025 So, even if you weren’t in on the NYFW action this week, consider it a styling proposal to add fun hosiery to your winter wardrobe: Why slip on classic black or tights when you can inject an outfit with a great print or bold color instead? Do it, and a street style photographer may even track you down and ask for a photo. Well, one can at least fantasize. Below, more whimsical hosiery from New York Fashion Week.

Street Style Snow Days,Streetwear,"Fashion shows must always go on—even when it snows. When it comes to braving the elements, be it flurries or a blizzard, street stylers rely on winter-proof—and stylish—furs and puffers. There is always someone who is willing to risk frostbite to make a fashion statement in a mini skirt or bare skin. What camp do you fall into? See the best street-style looks in the snow below.

What Is the Difference Between Bootcut and Flare Jeans?,Sustainable Fashion,"When Kendrick Lamar hit the stage at the Super Bowl Halftime Show, we had many pressing questions: What does his “a” necklace stand for? Would he perform “Not Like Us?” And most urgently, Where did he get those jeans? All questions were soon answered (the logo for Lamar’s communication company pgLang, but it served as a nice double entendre for his lyric “a minoooor”; yes and he called Drake out by name; Celine). But Lamar’s statement pants opened the gates to a new quandary: were they bootcut jeans or flares? The question made me pause. Are flares bootcuts like a square is a rectangle? Kind of. Flares seem more clear-cut: hip- and thigh-hugging pants that dramatically kick out at the knee. Another noted fan of the look is Pharrell Williams, whose proclivity for the retro pants has made its way into his Louis Vuitton menswear. Pharrell Williams in flare jeans. Bootcut jeans, however, seem to have some more leeway. They adopt a more straight-legged silhouette with a less exaggerated flare below the knee. Rather, they’re meant to accommodate a boot, not make a disco-inspired statement. While they can lean more bodycon, bootcut can also adopt a baggy form. Beloved by naughties royalty Beyoncé and Jennifer Aniston, they’ve found a new life in the 2020s, namely on models like Bella Hadid. (Given Hadid’s rodeo activities, it only makes sense she’d be into them.) While people remain divided, Celine weighed into the debate, categorizing Kendrick Lamar’s light-wash denim as flares. So at least one case is settled. Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

Everything You Need to Know About the 2025 Met Gala,Red Carpet,"The 2025 Met Gala is officially only a few months away! Read on for everything you need to know about fashon’s biggest night—from the date to the theme, co-hosts, and this year’s dress code. The Met Gala is a charity event and fundraiser for The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. It has traditionally been timed to mark the opening of the department’s annual fashion exhibition. Year after year, the event raises eight-figure sums. The 2025 Met Gala will take place on Monday, May 5. On Wednesday, October 9, the Metropolitan Museum of Art announced the Costume Institute’s spring 2025 exhibition, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” Drawing inspiration from Monica L. Miller’s 2009 book Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity, the exhibition is organized into 12 sections, each representing a characteristic that defines dandy style: Ownership, Presence, Distinction, Disguise, Freedom, Champion, Respectability, Jook (defined in Zora Neale Hurston’s “Characteristics of Negro Expression”—an important reference for the exhibiton—as a space for dancing, drinking, and other leisure activities), Heritage, Beauty, Cool, and Cosmopolitanism. “Superfine” will feature garments, paintings, photographs, and more from artists including Torkwase Dyson, Tanda Francis, André Grenard Matswa, and Tyler Mitchell—all exploring the indelible style of Black dandies, from the 18th century through to the present day. (Miller will also serve as a guest curator for the show, working alongside Costume Institute Curator in Charge Andrew Bolton.) Colman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, A$AP Rocky, Pharrell Williams, and Anna Wintour will co-chair the 2025 Met Gala, with LeBron James serving as an honorary chair. Reviving a tradition from years past, the 2025 Met Gala will also have a host committee, made up of André 3000, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Jordan Casteel, Dapper Dan, Doechii, Ayo Edebiri, Edward Enninful, Jeremy O. Harris, Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, Rashid Johnson, Spike Lee and Tonya Lewis Lee, Audra McDonald, Janelle Monáe, Jeremy Pope, Angel Reese, Sha'Carri Richardson, Tyla, Usher, and Kara Walker. This just in: the Met Gala 2025 dress code is “Tailored for You,” a nod to the exhibition’s focus on menswear and suiting that’s sure to bring out the sartorial creativity of this year’s attendees. That’s kept largely under wraps; guests must abide by a no-phone (and, therefore, no social media) policy once they’ve entered the museum. But the run-of-show involves dinner—overseen this year by chef Kwame Onwuachi, of the restaurants Tatiana in Lincoln Center and Dōgon in Washington, DC—and a high-profile performer (or two). Attendees also always have a moment to explore the exhibition. See exclusive photos from inside the 2024 Met Gala here, and catch a glimpse of the table settings, menu, and decor last year here. The Met Gala takes place at The Metropolitan Museum of Art each year. Guests from out of town (and even some based in the city) typically stay at hotels nearby, congregating at a few celebrity-favorite spots. In 2023, the Mark Hotel was a prime location for star-spotting; see our photos from inside its halls. The event usually hosts about 450 attendees, welcoming stars, young creatives, and paragons from the worlds of fashion, the arts, sports, and politics. Revisit some of the best looks from long-time attendees Blake Lively, Sarah Jessica Parker, Rihanna—and even more of the most memorable Met Gala fashions of all time.

“Black Dress II: Homage” Celebrates A History Of Black Fashion In America,Red Carpet,"At Pratt Manhattan Gallery on 14th street, a celebration of Black designers and creatives rises to honor the work of generations. “Black Dress II: Homage” explores the history of American fashion, through the lens of the Black artists whose work has pioneered and defined the industry, often without recognition. The show marks the ten year anniversary of the original “Black Dress” exhibit, created in 2014 by Adrienne Jones, a tenured professor at the Pratt Institute. Jones received a series of scrapbooks from Clara Branch, a former faculty member at the Fashion Institute of Technology, as well as Jones’s mentor. In them, she found a careful catalog of Black designers, some of whose names had since been lost to history. So was born “Black Dress,” an exhibit intended to share and preserve their legacies. “This is a love letter to the fashion industry, particularly the Blacks in fashion… but also to Clara Branch, continuing her legacy,” says Jones. Who knew that some scrap clippings would turn into what it is today?” Today, Jones and her co-curator Rachelle Etienne-Robinson are reviving the legacy with an expanded viewpoint, curating the work not only of fashion designers, but of Black creatives whose work covers beauty, styling, and celebrity culture. There will be a part of the exhibit celebrating fashion journalism titled Black Book; for jewelry it’s Black Gold; for models, Black Face. A number of brands from the first exhibition will return including Byron Lars, Sammy B, and Epperson. Their work will sit next to renowned designers of decades past, from CFDA Award winner Jeffrey Banks, to Haitian-born Fabrice—known for his opulence—to Patrick Kelly, a beloved designer of the 1980s. Two-time Oscar nominated costume designer Paul Tazewell (including currently for Wicked) lent costumes from The Temptations. There will also be a piece from the 2024 Olympics designed by Telfar Clemens. Curating the collection involved not just the years of hard work put in by Jones and Etienne-Robinson, sometimes it was also about a bit of luck. The two were hunting for a specific ironing board, to be displayed as an homage to Sarah Boone, a formerly enslaved woman who had the patent for what became the modern ironing board. All set to buy the piece, a well-timed conversation suddenly found them with one in their possession, lent by a friend. For Emmy-nominated producer Keli Goff, the current exhibition will be her first time lending a piece of clothing from her own closet. Goff, who describes her collecting as a hobby turned obsession, was put in touch with Jones and Etienne-Robinson as they were searching for a Patrick Kelly dress to include. “You've got to either give me a year or a color or a print or something, because I have a lot,” Goff remembers telling them. News often travels by word-of-mouth in the network of Black fashion collectors and curators. Goff, attending a luncheon with her beloved Patrick Kelly dress in hand to drop off at Pratt after, was approached by author and former Vogue writer Nell Scovell. It turns out, Scovell owned the matching dress to Goff’s pink and white jacket, a piece which she had purchased on the day she learned that Kelly had passed away. Now, the two will be shown in the exhibit together. A museum exhibition is an opportunity to witness both the evolution and sheer volume of Black talent, bringing together works that span decades. But, outside of the museum walls the work continues. Says Jones, “we want to pay homage to those who have been doing the work and haven't necessarily gotten the recognition that they deserve” One issue Jones found in curating the first “Black Dress” exhibition was lack of preservation. In researching previous exhibits on Black designers, she found that assembled knowledge often disappeared once the show’s tenure ended. Any history gained, was lost again. Between the first and second exhibits, Jones built a lasting infrastructure, including a website and talk series with the intent to protect and expand the knowledge collected in curating the show for future generations. A continuation of Branch’s legacy, defined by the digital age. Though it leaves curators divided, Goff explains that she wears many of her pieces, including on the red carpet, as a way to spark conversation about forgotten designers or those who have yet to get their due. “It's a larger conversation about accessibility and storytelling,” she says. Worn once, precious items like her Ann Lowe dress will now remain tucked away and protected until they’re safely situated at their final home in a museum. With hopes of a potential tour or permanent space, Jones and Etienne-Robinson see the current exhibition not as an end-point, but as the next step in their journey. “We're not saying that this is everybody,” says Etienne-Robinson. “It still continues to grow and evolve.” A good sign: Etienne-Robinson and Jones are already fielding emails from designers wondering why they weren’t included in the show. “We're two people doing this work and there’s still a lot of work to do.” “Black Dress II: Homage” is on view at Pratt Manhattan Gallery through March 22,2025. The exhibition is free. Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

2025 Just Got Even Better for GloRilla,Streetwear,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. You’ve likely seen the video: Dressed in a black tee, nude tights, and oversized burgundy sunglasses, Rihanna emphatically raps along to GloRilla’s “TGIF,” positioned inside a hotel room door frame. Does A$AP Rocky’s look of bewilderment keep Rih from belting, “It’s 7 p.m. Friday, it’s ninety-five degrees!” with the utmost enthusiasm? No. Do her stiletto heels prevent her from dropping it low when she reaches mid verse? Absolutely not; a GloRilla hit will have that effect on you. The July 2024 video served as proof that Rihanna is just like us: a big GloRilla fan. So much so that when it came time to pick a face for her Fenty empire—the first that would represent the brand across Fenty Beauty, Hair, Skin and Savage x Fenty—the Memphis-born rapper was the obvious choice. “I want to say I was at home in my car,” GloRilla tells Vogue of learning that she’d be the newest Fenty ambassador, “and I was so excited about it.” Home for the star is currently Atlanta, but when we speak, it’s the Saturday before the 2025 Grammys, and the tattooed rapper with a singular southern accent is in L.A. rehearsing for a performance at Battle of the Bands. Though versions of the HBCU marching band competition have taken place in Tennessee, “I never went to one, actually,” Glo says, “and I always wanted to.” Now, she’s as much of a draw as the bands themselves (if not more), a two-time Grammy nominee, and the face of all things Fenty. Here, GloRilla talks about the whirlwind of fame, her love of Rihanna, wearing Savage x Fenty, and more—exclusively with Vogue. Vogue: You’re a noted Rihanna fan and now the face of Fenty. Tell us about your earliest Rihanna memory. Glorilla: first song I heard from her was “Umbrella,” and I just fell in love with her. My mom used to always say that I looked like her, and when I went places people would tell me that. I loved it, and I loved her music. How are you enjoying life in Atlanta? It's good. It's like an upgraded version of Memphis—a more resourceful version. And when I want to go home, it’s just six hours to drive. You drive home? I ride home. I don't drive, I got a driver. Nice. So prior to shooting your Fenty campaign, did you use any Fenty Beauty products or wear any Savage x Fenty? I love Fenty lip gloss—the one in the square tube. It may be in my purse right now. And my makeup artist uses a highlighter on me that I love. It makes my face so shimmery. And I don't like soft baby hairs, I like the gelled down baby hair look, so I've been using the edge control. Speaking of hair, tell us about your hair journey. How did you wear your hair growing up? My momma did my hair for the most part until I got into high school. She was still doing the little clips and stuff when I was in middle school, and I used to hate it. I was too grown to be wearing my hair like that! I was like, “this is a five-year old’s hairstyle.” When I got 14, 15, I started letting real hairstylists do my hair, and I started with the weaves and everything. Did you perm your hair when you were younger? Uh huh. My momma permed my hair when I was like four years old. And do you still perm your hair today? No, I've been natural for two years now, since October 2022. What has that adjustment been like for you? I went natural years ago and it was a challenge. Well I'm 1000 percent tender-headed, so I hate getting my hair braided. I keep my braids in for months at a time because I be crying when I get my hair done. I don't do nothing with my real hair but keep it underneath wigs. I think I know the answer to this, but what’s your favorite way to wear your hair? I wear a side part, for the most part. I like black, and I do blonde sometimes. Right. You went with black hair for your Fenty campaign shoot. What was that shoot like? It was a good day. I like shooting when I look real cute in everything I have on. I don't like photo shoots where I have to look a certain type of way and I can't pick what I want to do. But I was comfortable in everything I was putting on, so it was a good shoot. Did you have a favorite look? I liked all of them. I'm real thick so I looked good in everything. And I'm comfortable with my body now because I've been in the gym. Everything fit me perfect. Thinking back to that video of Rihanna dancing to 'TGIF,"" what was your reaction? I was just screaming. I was like, “Oh my God.” I had just dropped the song and I was going to perform it at the BET Awards, and I was at rehearsals. I sat down to take a break, hopped on Instagram, and that’s the first thing I saw. I couldn't believe it. I just screamed. I was like, “Ya’ll, Rihanna just posted me!” Tell us, when you started your career, what did you envision for it and how is that the same or different from what it has grown into? I ain't going to lie, I knew I was going to make it. I always had faith in myself, but I didn't know I was going to be as big as I am. I didn't think I'd be doing all of this. What has the adjustment to fame been like? I think I'm finally adjusting to it. The first two years I still wasn't used to it, but I think I'm getting used to it. I'm still appreciating everything that comes my way, though. I'm not taking nothing for granted. I'm still excited for everything. What do you hope people take away from your campaign? That I'm grown and sexy now. I used to be a little tomboy, but I'm 25 now, I'm in my golden era. I just feel like I done stepped into myself, into my grown woman era.

"Demi Moore Takes Paris, Dressed Like the Award Statuette She Deserves",High Fashion,"Couture week is in full swing in Paris, and the celebrities have been storming the streets in their very best. Jennie had her own twist to the naked dressing trend, Kylie Jenner cropped her tweeds, and Dua Lipa brought her biggest hairbow to Chanel. Schiaparelli attendees—from Regina King to Kelly Rutherford—opted for crisp, winter whites, while Jenna Ortega and Anya Taylor-Joy went hell for leather for Dior. Demi Moore, however, is staying true to her campaign trail wardrobe. The very recent first-time Academy Award nominee stepped out in Paris for the Armani Privé spring 2025 show, dressed like a sleek, gilded statuette. The Substance actor wore a stiff, nipped in metallic Armani jacket with a sculpted peplum waist, black velvet trousers, and Louboutin stilettos. She accessorized with a stacked, layered black beaded necklace, and wore a pop of cherry red on her nails to match her red-bottomed shoes. Right beside her was her longtime stylist, Brad Goreski, who has surely been taking in what showstopping sparklers from fashion week he can pull for Moore next. It was a special evening, regardless, to be dressed like a trophy. The show marked 20 years of Giorgio Armani’s haute couture line Armani Privé, calling upon Armani’s most celebrated aesthetics and technical elements: shimmering, crystal-studded gowns, silky tailoring, jewel tones. Others on the front row with Moore included Jessica Biel and Dianna Agron, who joined in the rapturous applause for the legendary 90-year-old designer. Moore wore a custom gold, structured Armani Privé dress with rhinestone panelling and an exaggerated mermaid tail to The Golden Globes, where she picked up her first best actress award and gave a rousing speech. Next is Critics Choice, BAFTA, and the SAG awards. As a current forerunner for the Oscars nod, Ms Demi Moore could be picking up her first Academy Award in one of the metallic Armani dream gowns that graced the 8th arrondissement last night.

How to Choose the Best Glasses for Your Face Shape,Sustainable Fashion,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. I’ve always had trouble with glasses. While I find them adorable—even chic!—on other people, I’ve long felt that once I put on a pair, my look becomes very “finals week,” very quickly. For years, I tried to turn a blind eye to the whole thing, blithely waving at strangers and squinting at street signs. But it was only a matter of time, I knew, before I had to succumb to spectacles. (Also: Because I’m not one for touching my eyes, contacts were a non-starter.) So, I gave myself a mission: If I was to become a glasses person, I simply needed to find the best pair out there. We’ve seen how they can be a powerful, even evocative accessory. (Meryl Streep has practically made a career out of the dramatic handling of eyewear.) And there’s never been a shortage of design-forward options—just look at the spring runways, where sultry little spectacles abound. To wit: Just last week, the Khaite show accessorized chunky knits, smart trousers, and tailored jackets with ascot caps, sharp handbags, and a sprinkling of elegant eyewear. As Vogue Runway Director Nicole Phelps wrote in her review, designer Catherine Holstein’s success at Khaite comes down to how good she is with product. “Look around at the front rows during fashion month and a good percentage of women will be wearing her Nevada boots,” Phelps wrote, “others are carrying her Simona shoulder bag, or wearing her jeans.” Now, Khaite has added optical eyewear to its collection of covetable staples. A look from the recent Khaite collection, featuring the brand's new eyewear. Created in collaboration with the heritage eyewear brand Oliver Peoples, which also helped to launch Khaite’s debut sunglasses collection in the fall of 2023, the new line is made up of six styles in all, featuring three pairs of opticals: two cat-eyed silhouettes (one in metal, the other in a bold acetate) and a ‘70s-inspired oversized pair. Eagle-eyed fashion folk may recognize the golden corewire that runs the length of the frame as a nod to the hardware in Khaite’s bags. All three styles feel like a natural extension of Khaite’s signature cool-but-wearable look. “There’s a quiet confidence to opticals, a refinement that is part of your daily uniform,” Holstein tells Vogue. “We wanted these frames to feel inherently Khaite—understated and intentional.” My vision may be blurry, but even I can see that there has never been a better time to give glasses a go. I traveled to Oliver Peoples’s Madison Avenue shop to try some on. Below, the best tips for choosing truly inspired eyewear. There’s a bit of a science to choosing your ideal glasses shape—though it’s a deeply individual practice. George Lee, who has worked with Oliver Peoples for 12 years, breaks down the formula for selecting the most flattering eyeglasses for different face shapes. It’s all about balance: While those with triangular faces—characterized by a wider forehead and smaller chin—should opt for smaller frames, a narrower forehead and wider jawline are well served by larger frame. Similarly, if you have a square face, Lee suggests picking frames that are a bit rounded, to give your visage a touch of softness; and for round faces, square-shaped glasses will give your look greater definition. Generally speaking, you don’t want your glasses to obscure your brows: Ideally, the top of the frame will follow the brow bone and fall slightly below your eyebrows. As far as your coloring goes, the rule of thumb is to try to create contrast, but if you’re new to the optical game, something classic—say, a relatively thin oval or soft square acetate frame in black or tortoiseshell—will do just fine. If you are blessed with a lower prescription, your frames can come in virtually any size or style. Higher prescriptions, on the other hand, narrow the field a bit, tending to require smaller frames with thicker edges. Lee is careful about how many frames he shows each client; he doesn’t tend to pull more than 10-12 in total, so as not to overwhelm them with options. He also thinks it’s best to try glasses on solo, rather than choosing by committee. (Selfies, however, are fair game, and I’d suggest industriously circulating all options among your trusted council.) Just like clothing, eyewear is ultimately an extension of your taste and style: What makes a pair of glasses “good” comes down to what makes you happy. In my case, I followed Lee’s step-by-step guidance and selected a pair of delicately rounded specs that gave my brows plenty of room to breathe and balanced out (but didn’t overwhelm) my oval-shaped face. Their color—tortoiseshell with an ivory interior—played off both my lighter complexion and dark hair. Looking at my reflection, it was the first time I’d ever felt like myself in a pair of glasses. “Eyewear is about how you want to look as well as what’s flattering,” Lee told me at the end of our tutorial. “If you can combine that with what works aesthetically, it really hits.” Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1978RX eyeglasses OLIVER PEOPLES Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1953RX eyeglasses KHAITE Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1953RX eyeglasses KHAITE Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1998RX eyeglasses KHAITE Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1978RX eyeglasses OLIVER PEOPLES Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1953RX eyeglasses KHAITE Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1998RX eyeglasses KHAITE Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1953RX eyeglasses OLIVER PEOPLES Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

Saoirse Ronan’s Latest Look Proves the Color Analysis Trend Works,Red Carpet,"Saoirse Ronan’s style shift has been awe-inducing. Working with stylist Danielle Goldberg—a collaborator of filmic fashion girls Ayo Edebiri and Greta Lee too—Ronan has developed an elegant and understated, yet subversive set of sartorial codes. Think J.W Anderson asymmetric mini-dresses and archival Phoebe Philo-era Celine, pops of color and texture, and incorporating new-gen designers like Hodakova and Colleen Allen into the wardrobe. The actor’s latest outing adds to a thrilling stylistic oeuvre—and proves both she and Goldberg know the colors that work best for her. The Irish Film & Television Academy Awards took place in Dublin on Friday (February 14), celebrating the year in Irish film and television. Some of Ireland’s biggest names turned out for the ceremony, including Ronan, Cillian Murphy, Andrew Scott, Ruth Negga, Nicola Coughlan, and Sharon Horgan. For the occasion, Goldberg dressed The Outrun actor in custom Louis Vuitton by Nicolas Ghesquière. She wore the bold blue strapless gown with an empire waist and single pleat and kept to minimal accessories, with a set of Completedworks black drop earrings. Her hair was in a middle parting and tight bun, by Irish hairstylist Aidan Darcy, with a rose pink lip and a sweep of eyeliner by Vivien Pomeroy. Ronan is most certainly aware of what suits her on the color wheel. The royal blue shade and other hues of bright and more muted blue have cropped up in her wardrobe before: a J.W Anderson mini-dress, a silken navy Ferragamo shirt, and a puffball sleeve and skirted Louis Vuitton dress. A more electric shade of blue was even the color of her hair in her film The Outrun. Saoirse Ronan was one of the IFTA night’s most major names, winning two awards: Best Lead Actress for The Outrun, and Best Supporting Actress for Blitz. Proving blue is a winner’s color, will we see the shade carry her through to the weekend’s BAFTAs? More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Lady Gaga Performs in Delightful Mother Monster Fashion at the 2025 Super Bowl,Red Carpet,"It wouldn’t be the Super Bowl without a surprise celebrity performance, now would it? Tonight in New Orleans, just before the big 2025 game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles kicked off, singer Lady Gaga took to the stage for a special piano rendition of her 2022 song “Hold My Hand.” The pre-recorded performance, staged outside on the iconic Bourbon Street, was meant to serve as an uplifting tribute to the resilient local community in New Orleans, who all rallied and supported one another following the terrorist attack that occurred there on New Year’s Day. Gaga performed her touching song on the piano, accompanied by a live band. She chose an all-white look—a color often associated with peace, hope, and new beginnings—that felt perfectly appropriate for the occasion, given the mood of the night. But because she had to give her stage look a major Mother Monster feel, too, the star sported a dramatic wide-brimmed chapeau, as well as a white lace coat with a long, sweeping train. (The outerwear was similar in feel to the high-collared lace cape made of recycled wedding dresses that she recently wore in her new music video for “Abracadabra.”) Gaga released “Hold My Hand” back in 2022, as part of the Top Gun: Maverick soundtrack. Her live rendition of it on Sunday night made for an unexpected opening game-day moment—but one that was obviously greeted with delight by a stadium full of cheering fans.

Tyla Redefines the Naked Dress at the Jacquemus Show,High Fashion,"Earlier today (January 26) in Paris, Jacquemus designer Simon Porte Jacquemus assembled a star-studded crowd to take in his new fall 2025 collection. Some notable names the front row? Best actress Oscar nominee and Last Showgirl star Pamela Anderson, supermodel Carla Bruni, and singer-of-the-moment Tyla, among others. (Adriana Lima even walked the catwalk.) While each star in attendance was sure to bring a polished look to the affair, it was Tyla who donned one of the most head-turning designs of the show. The “Water” singer put her stamp on the still-persisting naked dress trend, which is all about showing skin thanks to slinky barely-there silhouettes. While many celebrities have braved the trend on the red carpet this past year—with stars like Hailey Bieber and Zoe Kravitz choosing totally-sheer dresses in lace or crystal-encrusted mesh fabrications—Tyla brought a new, refined twist. She chose a long, black maxi gown by Jacquemus that was completely open along the sides, exposing the side torso and a thong-style brief, too. Still, with it being mostly covered up, the end result was a revealing look that still felt polished and sophisticated, right down to her choice of minimal earrings. After all, when your killer body is the accessory, you simply don’t need much else. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

The 17 Most Stylish Celebrity Valentines,Streetwear,"Here at Vogue, there’s nothing we love more than a stylish celebrity couple. Personal style obviously conveys a great deal about the wearer, but a couple’s style gives us a peek into their dynamic. On one end of the spectrum, we have duos like Tom Holland and Zendaya, who are all in on coordination—be it their errands ’fits or their event looks. On the other end is Hailey Bieber and Justin Bieber, who often look as though they got dressed with entirely different briefs. The current reigning champions of celebrity couple style are Rihanna and A$AP Rocky, who never miss an opportunity to flex their fashion muscles. At the 2024 Fashion Awards, Rocky opted for an understated navy Bottega Veneta suit while Rihanna chose a dramatic vintage Christian Lacroix number complete with a feathered hat. And that’s nothing to say of their impeccable date night style, which they regularly flaunt on the streets of New York and Los Angeles. Red carpet couple style is an art form of its very own. At the 2024 Emmys, Saoirse Ronan and Jack Lowden made their red carpet debut as a married couple after secretly tying the knot in July. For their first appearance, Ronan met the moment in a navy blue draped Louis Vuitton two-piece, while Lowden coordinated in a matching navy tuxedo with black lapels. Meanwhile, on the 2024 Met Gala carpet, Queen Latifah and Eboni Nichols made a splash in custom Thom Browne. Happy Valentine’s Day from Vogue! Below, celebrate by revisiting some of our favorite celebrity couples—and their enviable style.

"It’s Time to Update Your Trench Coat, Per Stars Like Rihanna and Hailey Bieber",Streetwear,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. It’s currently peak coat season, and celebrities are slipping into their best statement outerwear to keep warm. What has been a hit amongst the A-list trendsetters recently? Elegant draped coats and plushy shearlings have been spotted on stars like Kendall Jenner and Ayo Edebiri. But for those in the less-frigid settings, a more lightweight coat has been taking off: Meet the modernized trench coat. At first glances these Rihanna and Hailey Bieber-approved coats may look like your average khaki trenches. But lean in a little closer to notice the details, and you’ll find a bevy of refreshing updates—be it the silhouette, the prints, or the fabrics—that give the trench coat a 2025-worthy feel. Leather trenches, whether in classic black or luxurious chocolate brown, have been one such way to make the wardrobe staple feel current. Rihanna paired hers with fitted snakeskin knee boots, while Anya Taylor-Joy wore a belted style with a chunky turtleneck sweater underneath. Gugu Mbatha-Raw also embraced a statement trench via a checkered Burberry version. If a lightweight cotton or twill treatment is more your speed, celebrities such as Mikey Madison and Monica Barbaro—two awards season darlings this year—have embraced the classic khaki trench in new shapes. With details like extra-slouchy fits or asymmetrical lapels, their reworked coats have just enough visual interest to make them feel new and exciting—without ever going out of style. But that’s the beauty of a trench, isn’t it? No matter if you go for a bold or subtle style, it will forever be a timeless hero piece that you can mix and matched. So, do like the stars and go for one that has some extra pizazz. As Nicki Minaj once said, “who wants to look simple when you could look stunning?” Below, see more modern approaches to the trench coat.

The spring 2025 haute couture collections have officially kicked off in Paris, with labels such as Schiaparelli and Christian Dior ushering in the first day of shows. Given it is a week focused on showcasing the finest craftsmanship and innovation that ateliers have to offer, it’s no surprise that the affair draws an A-list crowd in the front rows—all of whom match the elevated fashion energy with their own exquisite, elaborate looks. Some of the stylish celebrity sightings seen thus far? At Dior, stars leaned into the polished and elegant wears; Jenna Ortega styled a structured blazer with micro shorts, tights, and leather opera gloves, while Anya Taylor-Joy embraced a strappy fringed dress. At Schiaparelli, Regina King completed her crisp white suit with one of the label’s surreal face bags, while model Kendall Jenner—who walked the runway—emerged post-show in a brown leather blazer coat, complete with a suede Hermès Birkin bag to match. There are plenty more couture shows to come, so be sure to check back on this post, and see all of the A-list action as it unfolds in real time. Below, explore the best dressed stars at couture week.

Gracie Abrams Is Auditioning to Be the Next Chanel Bride at the 2025 Grammys,Red Carpet,"Gracie Abrams is helping to usher Chanel into its next era. In the interim between Virginie Viard’s departure and the beginning of Matthieu Blazy’s tenure as artistic director, the Chanel atelier has taken up the mantle of designing collections and dressed celebrities. Tonight at the 2025 Grammys, Abrams’s look served as a nod to the house’s past—and a glimpse of its future. Abrams, who is nominated for best pop duo/group performance award for her song “Us,” turned to the French maison for her red carpet look. The Chanel ambassador wore the palest yellow chiffon off-the-shoulder dress, cinched at the waist with a black velvet ribbon and embellished with a satin camellia on her chest. Attached to her dress was a diaphanous chiffon hood that flowed behind her like a bride’s veil. Abrams accessorized with Chanel high jewelry: diamond earrings set in white gold with pearl drops, and white gold and diamond rings from both the high jewelry and fine jewelry collections. The dress, with its chic simplicity, camellia appliqué, and black velvet detail, felt reminiscent of Karl Lagerfeld’s Chanel—and is certain to pique the interest of fashion fans curious to see where the house goes next.

The Best Dressed Stars at the 2025 Critics Choice Awards,Red Carpet,"After facing multiple delays due to the devastating Los Angeles wildfires, the 2025 Critics Choice Awards are finally underway in Santa Monica, California, hosted by Chelsea Handler for the third consecutive year. It’s no surprise that this year’s Critics Choice Awards, held at the Santa Monica Airport’s Barker Hangar—not far from the site of the Palisades Fire—were a relatively toned-down affair. (The E! red carpet pre-show was canceled ahead of the ceremony.) Matching the mood of the evening, many guests opted to wear darker and neutral tones—though that didn’t preclude them from dynamic fashion moments. Just take Demi Moore in navy strapless Schiaparelli, or Monica Barbaro in an ab-baring black Prada two-piece. There were plenty of colorful looks on the red carpet too, however. The Industry cast showed off high-octane looks, with leading ladies Myha’la and Marisa Abela in a sheer blue floral halter-neck and a rich maroon velvey Dior dress, respectively. (Their co-star Sagar Radia joined them in a pale pink suit.) Elsewhere on the carpet, Emilia Pérez nominee Zoe Saldaña opted for a cherry Saint Laurent, while Shōgun’s Moeka Hoshi also embraced the bold hue in Louis Vuitton. Other stars cast a wider net with their fashion, from Nicole Kidman’s structured suiting to Cynthia Erivo’s sequined peplum. Below, see Vogue’s picks for best dressed at the 2025 Critics Choice Awards. Colman Domingo in Boss and Tiffany & Co. jewelry Is this your favorite look?

Taylor Swift’s Red Hot Grammys Jewelry Hints at Her Devotion (and Maybe Reputation),Red Carpet,"Tonight, Taylor Swift attended the 2025 Grammys in a one-shouldered ruched mini dress by Vivienne Westwood—in a very intentional shade of Chiefs red, of course. But the outfit also came with a surprising accessory: a piece of thigh jewelry by Lorraine Schwartz with a single charm letter reading: “T.” Speaking in terms of Eras—because this is Swift, of course—I haven’t quite been able to pinpoint the current Era she’s dressing for. What I do know is that I’ve always considered myself more of a 1989 kind of girl… until tonight. First things first: Yes, this could be a “T” for Taylor—obviously I’m a feminist, and I thought of that too—but we know that Swift likes to wear the initials of her partners. In “Call It What You Want,” from her Reputation album, Swift sang: “I want to wear his initial on a chain round my neck not because he owns me but ’cos he really knows me, which is more than they can say.” So I’m going to suspend belief for a moment and imagine that the “T” stands for Travis (Kelce, duh) and that Taylor’s message is twofold: Offering a nod to her passionate romance with Kelce while also hinting that Reputation, Taylor’s Version is indeed coming soon. The relationship is hot—I mean, have you seen the photos of them kissing after he wins games?—and she wants them to know she’s devoted. And I have to say, I am obsessed. As a girl who wears a Hart charm necklace with the letter “R” hanging between my breasts like I’m Anne Boleyn (my partner’s name is Ramiro), I love devotion jewelry. So I guess it’s time for me to step up my game—calling Lorraine Schwartz asap.

Angelina Jolie Brought a Boho Twist to the Naked Dress Trend at the 2025 Critics Choice Awards,Red Carpet,"Angelina Jolie has her fashion formula down for red carpets. Across the promo for her film Maria, the actor has stepped out in elegant and minimalist dresses, finding comfort in neutral colors and ethereal silhouettes. Attending last night’s Critics Choice Awards 2025, Jolie was nominated in the best actress category. Her look brought her own understated take on the ever-enduring naked dress trend. Angelina Jolie at the Critics Choice Awards 2025 in an Elie Saab dress. For the event, Jolie opted for her signature style of simple elegance with a boho touch, wearing a sheer beige lace dress with relaxed sleeves and V-neckline from Elie Saab’s spring 2025 collection. She kept her hands and neck bare, wearing only barely there drop earrings. For her glam, she kept it to pops of red, with cherry red lips and nail polish. Her hair continued the boho vibe, blonde with darker roots that gave it dimension, and long feathery, ’70s bangs. Jolie was up in the same category as Wicked’s Cynthia Erivo, Demi Moore for The Substance, Karla Sofía Gascón for Emilia Pérez, Marianne Jean-Baptiste for Hard Truths, and Anora’s Mikey Madison. Moore took the win for the night, wearing full Schiaparelli. Throughout her press tour for the Pablo Larrain film, Jolie has turned out in multiple chic ensembles. Always elegant, whether she’s in a vintage gown with no label or a sleek three-piece suit. More recently at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, she showed her continued love of the slinky A-lister dress, wearing a champagne-colored silk floor-length dress with a draped white blazer. Boho chic, slinky megastar ensembles, naked dressing—Angelina Jolie’s long cultivated red carpet looks remain unmatched. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Jennifer Lawrence Adds a Modern Classic to Her Maternity Wardrobe,Streetwear,"Somehow, it’s still coat season. Dressing for warmth and style is no mean feat, as all those who navigated freezing temperatures and sleet-soaked streets at New York Fashion Week will know, but Jennifer Lawrence, for one, has cracked the code. The actor, who is expecting her second child, stepped out in a leopard-print coat from By Malene Birger that channels ’60s mod energy with a 2025 flair. Considered a neutral by those in the know, a leopard coat is the ultimate winter wardrobe staple. J Law paired hers with The Row’s ludicrously capacious Park Tote and a pair of oversized tortoiseshell sunglasses: a masterclass in incognito chic. A fashion week favorite, the leopard-print coat has made a roaring comeback, this time in iterations that feel more timeless than trend-driven (lest we forget the 2014 Topshop coat that did the rounds). Gone are the fast-fashion versions of the past, this season’s take is all about refined silhouettes and grown-up fabrics. So, while a New York winter may be relentless, Jennifer proves that a statement coat is all you need to keep things fun when it’s freezing. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

How Sonam Kapoor Gets Ready For a Dior Couture Show,High Fashion," Paris Couture Week has been filled with A-listers, and the Dior spring 2025 show was particularly star-studded. In attendance were Jenna Ortega and Anya Taylor-Joy, as well as Sonam Kapoor, who allowed Vogue to document her getting-ready process in a new video. “Today’s show is very special to me,” the actor said as she began the glam process. “The artwork, which serves as the backdrop to the show, was done by Rithika Merchant; I was so inspired by her that I commissioned a special artwork when my son was born.” Kapoor and Dior share a long history. As a muse to the house for years, Kapoor remembers the first day she began working with the French house. “Dior and I have had an associations since I was 22 years old, for my film Aisha,” says Kapoor. “Dior lent me all these amazing looks and the Lady Dior bag.” It was only natural, then, that Kapoor turn out for the label’s latest couture presentation. Besides, she can’t get enough of the City of Light either. “I love Paris, it’s such a nice place to be if you’re an artist,” she says. “I love to go to the museums. My favorite is the d’Orsay. I always get inspired, and every time I go there, I feel different.” After finishing hair and makeup, and taking a quick break to order room service—French fries, naturally!—Kapoor was ready to slip into her showtime look. The Indian star is styled by her sister, Rhea Kapoor, and together, they landed on a classic look including a netted black dress and faux fur coat.  “It’s draped really wonderfully,” Kapoor said of the dress. “It reminds me of an Indian outfit, but it’s not. It’s sexy, and very sporty and cool at the same time.”  The Kapoor sisters punctuated the look with traditional Indian accessories, such as Sahara earrings and black gajra hair flowers. When it comes to finding those perfect red carpet looks, both Rhea and Sonam agree: Their mother, a former model and fashion designer, serves as their forever style inspiration. “Sonam’s personal style has always been exuberant and joyful,” says Rhea. “She really has an appreciation for everything that goes into making a moment; I think that came from my mom.” Above, watch Kapoor’s full getting-ready video.

Kendall Jenner Road Tests the Latest Trends In Her Model-Off-Duty Style,Streetwear,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Couture week demands only the finest fashions and Kendall Jenner came ready to deliver. The model jetted to Paris to close out Daniel Roseberry’s Schiaparelli spring 2025 couture show in an opulent corseted gown. But off the runway, Jenner used her model-off-duty style to try out the latest trends. The night before the Schiaparelli show, Jenner embraced the latest emphasis on menswear, joining the likes of Hailey Bieber, Ayo Edebiri, and Mikey Madison in the new necktie craze. The model leaned into power clashing in Bottega Veneta, wearing a black and yellow striped button-up with a matching tie, underneath a plaid, double-breasted jacket with a cinched waist and wide sleeves. Jenner finished off the businesslike look with black trousers, loafers with white socks, and black sunglasses. Kendall Jenner in Paris, January 26 The following day, post-catwalk, Jenner tried out a different trend: double collars. Layered lapels have been all over the runway from Rabanne to The Row. A devoted fan to the latter, Jenner swapped her Schiaparelli couture for a lambskin leather blazer, which she wore over a plain white tee and black pants. Ever on-trend, she accessorized with a brown suede Hermès Kelly.

"Happy Birthday, Tyla! Revisit Her Naughties Pop Star Style",Streetwear,"Tyla may not have been alive during the original Y2K era, but she is more than capable of reviving the trend. While the “Water” singer is known for her distinctive South African-inspired sound, she has also honed a singular fashion sense. The singer’s style can be defined, first and foremost, by its sexiness. Tyla has simply never met a cutout, animal print, or thigh-high slit she didn’t like. She’s quickly become a muse for designers, like with the Balmain sand sculpture (made of actual sand) she wore to the 2024 Met Gala or the mint green crystal netted Atelier Versace number she wore to her first Grammys—where she took home the award for Best African Music Performance. But she’s also become a serious player in the vintage game, too. At the 2024 CFDA Awards, Tyla mixed old and new, wearing a black lace minidress from Tom Ford’s spring 1996 collection for Gucci with a pair of brat green hotpants underneath. And for the 2024 BET Awards, she wore a fall 2004 Versace dress that ticked all of her boxes: the black floor-length gown featured a hip-high slit, plunging cutout, and yellow animal print train. While she tends to stay away from direct references with her naughties style, Tyla did pay homage to Aaliyah with the blue tiger-striped Roberto Cavalli dress she wore to the MTV EMAs from the designer’s fall 2000 collection. In honor of Tyla’s birthday, take a look back at some of the singer’s best looks to date. At the Jacquemus fall 2025 show. In Balmain at the 2024 Met Gala. Performing in custom Michelle Hébert in Times Square on New Year’s Eve. In Louis Vuitton at the Prelude to the 2024 Paris Olympics. In spring 1996 Gucci at the 2024 CFDA Awards.

"Kid-Tested, Vogue-Approved: Playtime With Spring’s Most Whimsical Accessories",Sustainable Fashion,"“Can you say ‘Hi, Vogue’ to the camera?” Eita, 3, looked at Lucy Dolan-Zalaznick, from Vogue’s social team, with bewilderment. “Who is Vogue? I don’t know them.” This may have been true for many of the toddler models who arrived at Studio 5 on the 24th floor of the World Trade Center last week, but within an hour of the shoot, they all knew exactly who Vogue was: an Oz-like benefactor providing toys and playspace on a chilly winter Friday. When the Vogue fashion editors returned from Europe in October, one of the resounding takeaways from the spring 2025 shows was a wide embrace of the childlike and playful, from the animal beanbag seating at Bottega Veneta (I was partial to the otter) to Coperni’s Euro Disneyland spectacular. As a parent of two toddlers who live and breathe Richard Scarry, I found Matthieu Blazy’s giant intrecciato leatherbound Biggest Word Book Ever to cause a rare moment of fashion awe. Elsewhere, Alessandro Michele gave models kitty cat purses at his first Valentino show; Moschino showcased hand-scribbled bags and shoes; and models at Coach hugged oversized leather teddy bear clutches and had toy taxi cabs affixed to their sneakers. With designers so intent on leaning into childlike whimsy, we thought: Who better to take them up on their creations than actual children? The offspring of various Vogue staffers were called to duty. Calliope, 2, is pleased with a Bottega Veneta bag. “You can’t wear that hat, can you?” photographer Jeff Henrikson challenged Henry, 2, using the oldest trick in the book. Henry quickly insisted he could indeed wear the voluminous Marni topper. With reference boards creating six scenarios, from “adventure playtime” to “dress-up tea party,” Henrikson, himself a father to two toddlers, was a deft handler of tiny people with outsize egos. Eve, 2, absolutely refused to wear anything but the Simone Rocha crocs–which were not on her board! Instead, she demanded two purses, “all the jewelry,” and “Elsa sunglasses,” which were in fact vintage Miu Miu. Henry, 2, wears a Marni hat while pondering a fruit surprise ball from Bonjour Fete. Many of these Vogue youth happen to be friends off-set: Henry and Eve, who have spent weekends together, shuffled towards each other for a cozy greeting; and Agnes, 5, gave Eita a big “hello.” Meanwhile, overwhelmed by the number of onlookers, Calliope, 2, requested a closed set and insisted on a pink or purple purse, but was forced to settle for Bottega Veneta’s hand-appliquéd Andiamo bag. And Alice, who had a hard out for her early dinner time, kept announcing it was time to go home while holding cobalt fringed Ferragamo heels to her face like a hangry Munch’s The Scream. Alice, 2, considers her own art while examining a Moschino bag. Nearing her hard out with Ferragamo shoes. Agnes took the assignment the most seriously, arriving directly from school and announcing that she was pleased with the bejeweled Simone Rocha platform crocs but had feedback about the Valentino kitty clutch: “Too heavy.” Eita also seemed to understand the gravity of the situation, removing his shoes and putting on clean socks to stand on top of Bottega Veneta’s $10,000 ladybug bean bag. He was, however, more starstruck to meet Corduroy the Bear and Lowly Worm. Grant, 6, also showed up after school and was very proud of his handstand skills, but fortunately held back while wearing Loewe’s clown brogues, with their rather dangerously elongated toe box. And Khalin, 2, arrived roaring—lion in hand—and raring to go, very glad to play with a Noah’s Ark line of Schleich animal figurines while wearing a crimson Marni hat.

Hailey Bieber Makes the Mommy Bag Chic,Streetwear,"Hailey and Justin Bieber have spent much of the start of 2025 in New York, following a holiday season in Aspen. The Biebers made a rare appearance with their infant son Jack, and Hailey had the perfect mom bag to make both a chic and sensible night out with the family. Yesterday (January 31) on a chilly evening on the Upper East Side, the Rhode founder stepped out in a monochromatic black outfit, wearing a cropped black faux fur coat, black tailored pants, and pointed black boots. She wore sunglasses, her brown hair long and likely her latest product, the Rhode Peptide Lip Shape. Aside from her oval-cut wedding ring, vintage Piaget watch, and stylish Doona stroller for her five-month-old, Hailey Bieber’s main accessory of choice was a capacious black shoulder bag. As the trend of handbag shapes hath swung once again into the big and bold territory, Bieber has been shouldering larger bags from Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent, and even a Mrs Bieber-embroidered LL Bean tote. This time, she opted for The Row’s New Bindle leather bag: Its triangle silhouette and single draped handle make it roomy and comfortable, able to hold as many lip tints or baby formula as one may require. It’s been eight years since Bieber showed British Vogue what’s in her bag—we’re due a round two. Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

Mikey Madison Is Committed to This Ladylike Shoe Trend,Streetwear,"Mikey Madison has been nominated at every major awards ceremony of the season, emerging as one of the frontrunners—alongside Demi Moore—for best actress at the forthcoming Academy Awards. A solid Oscars campaign requires a lot of promo and appearances, with the right footwear. And Mikey Madison has a particularly elegant shoe silhouette she’s come to rely on to carry her through the season. The Anora actor was photographed yesterday (February 5) in London, where she was set to attend the BAFTAs Rising Star party to celebrate her own nomination later that evening. She wore a tailored beige Fall 2024 Burberry coat, Chanel oval sunglasses, a Ferragamo front flap crossbody, and Tiffany rings. Instead of the rough and ready combat boots the Burberry look was originally styled with on the runway, Madison chose a pair of Ferragamo T-bar pumps in patent khaki. While out in New York City at the beginning of the year, Madison paired a powdery blue Patou set with another pair of black patent Ferragamo pumps with the wraparound T-strap. The T-bar heel harks back to the ’40s and ’50s, a polite shoe silhouette worn often by Audrey Hepburn. It began to make more of an appearance in fashion again last year, and has been worn more recently by Zoe Saldaña and Ariana Grande, from Jimmy Choo and Khaite respectively. Stylist Jamie Mizrahi—who also works with the likes of Jennifer Lawrence and Riley Keogh—has helped the actor double down on a chic, feminine aesthetic. They’ve mastered movie star glamor for the film festival circuit and red carpets by way of Chanel haute couture gowns and tweet suits, velvet and silk Prada numbers, and Matthieu Blazy’s last custom Bottega Veneta dress. She’s also not afraid of playing with fashion too, with a sleek Saint Laurent suit, or pulling straight from the runway, like the red nail-studded Schiaparelli spring 2024 finale look as worn by Kendall Jenner. Madison’s jaunt to London has been full of more ladylike fashion. For the London Critics’ Circle Film Awards, she wore a bright red silk Simone Rocha gown with a halterneck that fastened with two giant bows and fell with a devilishly low back. She wore another all-red outfit for the BAFTAs Rising Star party, with Mizrahi styling Madison in archive Giorgio Armani recreated from a ’90s collection. The red blazer and matching belted dress was styled with elegant black gloves, sheer tights, and black pumps.

Lady Gaga and Anya Taylor-Joy Cosign the Return of the Can Can Boot,Streetwear,"It should come as no surprise that A Star Is Born lead Lady Gaga is a musical theater afficionado. But the singer even managed to incorporate a nod into her latest look. Yesterday, Gaga arrived at rehearsals for SNL’s 50th anniversary special dressed in an austere all-black look from Willy Chavarria’s fall 2025 collection: a black midi coat dress with a structured shoulder, swishy hem, and white kerchief peeking out of her breast pocket. But we couldn’t help but notice the singer’s shoes: a pair of pointy-toe lace-up booties—Jimmy Choo’s Scarlett boots, to be exact. The calf-high boot looked like a high-fashion reimagining of the Can Can boot, or something worn by a very chic member of The Music Man cast. Anya Taylor-Joy and Malcolm McRae in New York. Great minds think alike, it turns out. Last night, Anya Taylor-Joy also sported a pair of lace-up boots while attending Danielle Haim’s birthday party at Joyface in Manhattan’s East Village—albeit a much different interpretation. Taylor-Joy chose a pair of banana yellow KNWLS boots, complete with a pointy toe, buckle detail, and exaggerated tongue. The statement-making shoes served as a bright pop of color against her brown suede trench coat and black leather gloves. Can Can dancers perform in New Opera Company’s Broadway production of Merry Widow So, whether or not you count yourself as a musical theater fan, consider taking a page out of Lady Gaga and Anya Taylor-Joy’s books this winter and investing in a pair of Can Can boots.

New York Fashion Week Street Style Embraced a Ladylike Agenda—7 Outfits to Re-create,High Fashion,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. The fall 2025 New York Fashion Week shows have officially ended, and the city-dwelling street style scene is always one to watch. I mean, who does New York better than New Yorkers? Amid what felt like an eternity of larger-than-life silhouettes, it seems a new sartorial tide has turned. While you’ll never not see oversized shapes and head-to-boot monochromatic looks, a demure and sophisticated approach dominated the streets of Manhattan and Brooklyn: ladylike dressing. Structured jackets (some collarless, some cinched at the waist) first arrived on the scene last spring, and now we’re seeing these feminine sensibilities influence other categories. Showgoers embraced the modern lady, taking cues from the past with long leather gloves peeking out from elegant outerwear or affixed onto belts, brooches pinned to jacket lapels, and an array of silk scarves to add a burst of color and lightweight warmth (it’s still winter!). For an easy transition into the new season, there are a plethora of ladylike goodies—and styling tips—to take from the NYFW scene. From fitted coats and classic blazers to leather gloves, skinny belts, and more, here are our favorite street style looks to re-create from the uptown-meets-downtown-meets-Brooklyn crowd. Just when you think New York couldn’t get any gloomier, an eruption of vivid color emerges onto the scene. A patterned scarf and matching suede clutch add playful texture and print without overpowering the wearer.

Similar to the tassel phenomenon we saw debut on the fall-winter 2025 runways (at Altuzarra, Kallmeyer, and Tory Burch, for starters), one showgoer showcased a vintage bag with a tassel charm attachment.

Ariana Grande Is Back to Her Witchy Ways,Streetwear,"Ariana Grande was once again crowned the Witch of the West (Coast) yesterday when she hit the Santa Barbara International Film Festival dressed in—you guessed it—full Glinda attire. The Wicked star joined the likes of Selena Gomez, Mikey Madison, and Monica Barbaro for the festival’s Virtuosos Award. Grande looked the portrait of a good witch in a pink Giorgio Armani dress. The spaghetti strap gown was festooned with floral appliqués that trailed down her full ball skirt. Beyond the 3D flowers, the dress was embellished to the nth degree, from the pink rhinestoned straps to the polka-dot netted overlay floating atop the striped skirt. The custom Armani dress joins a long list of Grande’s Glinda-approved custom looks. She hosted SNL in a vintage magenta Thierry Mugler tulip dress from fall 1982, and attended the Olympics Opening Ceremony in Paris wearing a ladylike Thom Browne tea-length dress with a drop waist. (And that’s nothing to say of the custom Bode, Louis Vuitton, and Balenciaga she’s donned throughout her press tour.) But Grande has also departed from the Good Witch. For a brief period on the awards circuit, she adopted an homage to Audrey Hepburn in vintage Givenchy from 1966—and baby bangs to boot—at the 2025 Golden Globes. And at the 2025 Critics Choice Awards last week, she ditched vintage for fresh-off-the-runway Dior couture. But now as the Oscars approach, it seems Ariana Grande is fully switched back into Glinda mode. Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

Bad Bunny! Kate Moss! Calvin Himself! Everyone Turned Out for Calvin Klein’s NYFW Return,High Fashion,"Grace Burns and Eve Hewson giggled, their eyes darting as a St. Barth's baseball-capped gentleman passed them on the Calvin Klein embossed sisal carpet. The gentleman was none other than Benito, also known as Bad Bunny, casually slouching towards the front row at Calvin Klein. A scrum of photographers shifted their lenses from Calvin Klein himself towards the 30-year-old pop star. Then just before the lights dimmed, FKA Twigs and boyfriend, Jordan Hemingway scooched next to him on the bench. When the show began Bad Bunny watched poker-faced as former girlfriend Kendall Jenner strutted past, bespectacled and suited in look 3. Until today, Calvin Klein, the brand, had left a gap in the New York Fashion Week schedule for almost seven years. Now, at the garment district headquarters of the brand, the whole world and their mother showed up to herald the American brand’s return under the new stewardship of creative director Veronica Leoni, the first woman to take the lead. (The last time Calvin Klein was on the schedule was with Raf Simons in September 2018.) Speaking of everyone and their mother, the aforementioned Grace Burns is the daughter of Christy Turlington, with whom she arrived, both wearing straight-from-the runway looks. Turlington greeted another old-school Calvin face, Kate Moss herself, with an extended, shimmying hug before chatting with Mario Sorrenti and his wife, Mary Frey, and stylist Elizabeth Saltzman. Actor Greta Lee also took her spot front row in floor-skimming, fog-colored satin, alongside Bridgerton star Simone Ashley, in a strapless deconstructed dress. (It was only once the show began that it became clear the front row ensembles were previews from the collection). But it was Klein, flanked by Anna Wintour and his ex-wife Kelly, who garnered the most excitement from other attendees. Klein, who sold the company and retired in 2002, offered an endorsement of Leoni by watching the show from the front row (a rarity since his retirement). After stints at Jil Sander, Phoebe Philo’s Céline, and The Row, Leoni joins Calvin—and her sensibilities that reflect the brand’s namesake. She leads with sensuality, restraint, and functionality. “For decades, Calvin Klein interpreted the idea of bold self-expression, and I am willing to empower it with a strong accent on style and creativity,” she said when first hired. As Brooke Shields' famously said, “Nothing gets between me and my Calvins,” and today, on 39th Street, that seemed to Leoni's sentiment as well.
