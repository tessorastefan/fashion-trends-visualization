The Best Vintage Looks From the 2025 Awards Season,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/best-vintage-outfits-2025-awards-season,"February 18, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"When you think of awards season, you likely envision A-list stars hitting the red carpet in custom gowns and fresh-off-the-runway looks. But lately, vintage outfits have been all the rage in Hollywood. This awards season, we have seen a handful of stars embrace archival designs, proving that when well-styled, vintage silhouettes will always feel modern on the step and repeat. At the 2025 Golden Globes, Kylie Jenner sat alongside boyfriend Timothée Chalamet in a slinky Versace chainmail dress from the spring 1999 collection, famously worn by ElizabethHurley. (Jenner is no stranger to wearing vintage designer dresses: See some of her best throwback moments here.) Wicked star Ariana Grande also slipped into an archival design: a Givenchy couture gown from 1966. Its delicate beadwork and buttery yellow colorway felt retro, but not dated. Grande has, in fact, been sporting vintage silhouettes throughout awards season. At the Palm Springs Film Festival, Grande sported both an archival Chanel dress, as well as a vintage Christian Dior gown. More recently, at the Critics Choice Awards, Anora lead Mikey Madison chose a vintage black and white Armani gown from the label's fall 1992 collection. At the 2025 Grammys, Chappell Roan slipped into a charming Jean Paul Gaultier Couture dress from spring 2003, while Olivia Rodrigo went sleek and sexy in her black cutout Versace gown, from spring 2000. (Rodrigo is a big fan of archival designs.) As awards season continues on, you can be sure to see plenty more A-listers revive throwback designs. Of course, their decision to don vintage extends beyond just a fashion statement. By dipping into the archives, celebrities and their stylists have proved they are on board with recycling and rewearing, a form of fashion sustainability that's becoming increasingly common on the red carpets. It’s a thoughtful move: During awards season—when there’s so much pressure for celebrities to wear a plethora of extravagant looks—these vintage moments are a sartorial call for more consciousness on the red carpet (especially given that fashion and its supply chains have major impacts on the environment). To that we say, more vintage, please! Especially when it looks this good. Below, explore some of the best vintage looks from the 2025 awards season. In vintage Jean Paul Gaultier Couture (spring 2003) at the Grammys. In vintage Versace (spring 2000) at the Grammys. In vintage Armani (fall 1992) at the Critics Choice Awards.

The White Lotus Season 3 Fashion Is All About Loud Luxury,https://www.vogue.com/article/the-white-lotus-season-3-fashion-is-all-about-loud-luxury,"February 17, 2025",By Fawnia Soo Hoo,"Set on the picturesque island of Koh Samui, the third season of The White Lotus delivers plenty of immersive vacation porn as well as enviably audacious designer wardrobes on a new slate of badly behaving guests. “We don’t do quiet luxury,” says returning costume designer Alex Bovaird, who received two out of her three Emmy nominations for the first two seasons of the Mike White series. As a fresh set of potential Blossom Circle members take in the stunning views from the private boat to the resort, Raleigh, North Carolina, matriarch Victoria Ratliff (Parker Posey), tightly clutching her Gucci 1947 bamboo top-handle bag, turns down her nose at fellow guests—and the entire Thailand experience. With a bright blue silk scarf by Swaine London primly tied over the shoulders of her preppy Banana Republic shirtdress, Victoria wishes she was in England—or anywhere in western Europe—with her three children and sketchy financier husband Timothy (Jason Isaacs). “My inspiration for [the Ratliffs] was as if they just stepped out of a Ralph Lauren catalog,” says Bovaird. But Victoria did pack a suitcase, presumably checked first-class, of “loud Lilly Pulitzer”–esque dresses and floaty cover-ups, perfect for sipping mint juleps by a members-only pool. Bovaird referenced how the society set in Oxford, Mississippi, dress and the lifestyle of “the caftan queen of Birmingham, Alabama,” Susan Dumas. “She and her country club friends love vintage caftans,” says Bovaird, who also designed a resort-ready White Lotus–inspired collaboration with H&M. The eldest Ratliff sibling, Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger), thirsty for his withholding father’s approval, immediately telegraphs douchebag bro in one of his many Southern Tide polo shirts, wraparound Roger Federer sunglasses, and Gucci loafers sans socks. “His shorts are Brooks Brothers, and they’re just not the cool length,” says Bovaird. Younger sister Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook), who’s seeking spirituality on the island, hints at the burgeoning disconnect from her family with her ’80s-referential Ralph Lauren white lace dress. “She is a little bit more of the pure voice who’s looking for something more meaningful than her very materialistic family,” says Bovaird, who referenced a teenage Brooke Shields for Piper’s demure embroidered and lace-trimmed dresses. “[She’s] a bit more earthy, really wholesome, and a little more covered up.” Off to the side, a trio of 40-something childhood best friends giggle and gossip at the start of their decadent, and potentially debauched, reunion trip. In their coordinating sundresses, bags, and blonde highlights, they could be a girl group: TV actor Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan) in Alemais and Valentino; Austin socialite Kate (Leslie Bibb) in Paul Smith and Delvaux; and New York City lawyer Laurie (Carrie Coon) in Zimmermann and Loewe—check, check, and check. “They’re supposed to look interchangeable, but Laurie is the one who’s maybe trying to keep up with the girls,” says Bovaird. For the first-night dinner, Laurie dons a vintage Sue Wong watercolor-print jumpsuit, and later cries into her Giambattista Valli chain-link bag. Meanwhile, Kate, in red ruffle-tiered Lanvin, and Jaclyn, in a gold dragon-embroidered ’70s black vintage dress, trade fake, backhanded compliments. Jaclyn also employs her holiday as an opportunity for designer spon-con. “We imagined that she got a box of resort pieces that Valentino sent over. Maybe Kate grabbed a suit out of Jaclyn’s box,” says Bovaird. “Because that’s true to life—brands want to support actors.” For their first trip to the pool, Kate wraps a black-and-white panther-print sarong from the 2023 Escape collection around the waist of a Valentino hot pink maillot. Jaclyn, who’s regularly recognized by guests, appropriately called dibs on the showier, logo-mania pieces, like an oversized shirt cover-up and a flashy silver-sequined minidress. But odd couple Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood) and older boyfriend Rick (Walton Goggins) don’t quite fit in with the designer label–stacked façade of their fellow guests. “You’re supposed to bump up against them and think, Who are these two grifters? Because they are a little bit less put-together,” says Bovaird. “They seem like a couple of rogues. You’re just supposed to wonder what their story is, and they’re supposed to have a crackling sexual chemistry.” A grizzled Rick broods and smolders in a steady rotation of slouchy, halfway unbuttoned Hawaiian shirts, giving off the aura of an American expat with a questionable livelihood but deep pockets. Free-spirited Mancunian Chelsea takes selfies in a cutout My Beachy Side minidress. “She has this louche, sexy, Brigitte Bardot [vibe],” says Bovaird. “She’s been traveling for several years. We imagined she got the crochet dress from a market, or she collected things from Goa. She’s supposed to have this very market-driven, eclectic wardrobe.” Chelsea effortlessly mixes vintage with market-bought sarongs and minidresses, but her colorful bikinis are mostly by Corsica-based Tara Matthews. Chelsea also pairs a parrot-print vintage-looking Loewe wrap skirt with a throwback Blondie T-shirt, and carries JW Anderson and Louis Vuitton bags. “She has lots of sunglasses that she ‘got down at the market,’ but are actually by Jacquemus,” says Bovaird. Jacquemus also custom-designed two full looks for model Chloe (Charlotte LeBon), who a lonely Chelsea meets at the resort bar. (Keep an eye on Chloe’s “LBH”—“losers back home”—boyfriend, Gary, played by Jon Gries, who can’t seem to resist the nearest White Lotus location.) “[Jacquemus] designed special pieces just for The White Lotus in Thailand and hand-delivered them to Koh Samui,” says Bovaird about Chloe’s black-and-white polka-dotted bodysuit and striped, sequined skirt outfit that Chelsea admires, and a pink one-piece and sheer sarong for a yacht party. The White Lotus Maui spa manager Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) threads all three seasons of the slow-burn series together, as she spends a month at the Koh Samui outpost for a work-share session. She enjoys hands-on massage sessions with her very fit Thai counterpart, Pornchai (Dom Hetrakul)—and a resort wardrobe filled with colorful, tropical-print dresses and caftans from brands like Anthropologie and Verandah. “Belinda is a little self-conscious that she’s there on her work trip,” says Bovaird, who also custom-made looks with vibrant Thai fabrics for the character. “When she’s out of her uniform, she wants to feel as good as the guests.” Speaking of, what was it like putting Lalisa Manoban, aka Lisa of Blackpink, in a uniform to play resort staffer Mook? “I think it was refreshing for her not to worry too much about the bits and baubles, and making sure everything was super-fashionable,” says Bovaird. With the help of a local Thai crew, and input from Manoban, Bovaird custom-designed Mook’s blouse-and-sarong uniform. But the staffer first greets the guests in a cute palm-tree-and-monkey-embroidered short-sleeve shirt-and-shorts set that’s by Tombolo. “This season, we definitely upped our game,” says Bovaird. “We definitely had the right shoe for the right swimsuits, cover-ups, hats, bags, and sunglasses. Whereas, in season one, we were like, ‘Here are your flip-flops.’” Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

Ayo Edebiri Wore New York Fashion Week’s Rising Star for SNL 50,https://www.vogue.com/article/ayo-edebiri-snl-colleen-allen-new-york-fashion-week-rising-star,"February 18, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"It’s no secret that Ayo Edebiri quickly ascended to one of Hollywood’s best dressers in almost no time. While the actor has courted brands from Loewe to Prada, she’s always down to push the envelope with more avant-garde labels—with a helping hand from her stylist, Danielle Goldberg. Now, she’s the first to wear a brand-new piece from one of New York Fashion Week’s fast-rising stars, Colleen Allen. Edebiri was among the dozens of stars who participated in SNL’s 50th anniversary special over the weekend. The actor, who hosted the show in February 20204 returned to the hallowed halls of 30 Rock, joining Robert DeNiro, Drew Barrymore, Jimmy Fallon, and Rachel Dratch in a reprisal of “Debbie Downer.” Ayo Edebiri Colleen Allen fall 2025, look 2. The sketch was a black-tie affair, and Edebiri tapped Allen for the occasion, choosing a piece from the designer’s fall 2025 collection: a floor-length black velvet dress featuring a plunging, smocked neckline, which Edebiri styled with a black Sophie Buhai choker with a silver pendant. The dress debuted at NYFW just last week in an appointment-only presentation that my colleague José Criales-Unzueta described as “New York’s hottest club.” While Ayo Edebiri may not have been among the fashion editors who oohed and ahhed over Allen’s sumptuous velvets and rich color palette in person, she reminded us at SNL that she’s always got her finger on the pulse.

The Biggest Stars on the Front Row of London Fashion Week,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/celebrities-front-row-london-fashion-week,"February 21, 2025",By Daisy Jones,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Ah, London Fashion Week. It may not be as polished and starry as its New York counterpart, or as refined and sexy as its cousins across the channel, Paris and Milan…But what it lacks in glossiness, it more than makes up for in fun, grit, and playfulness. (Or so the common narrative goes, though the cliché exists for a reason). Amid all the fall winter 2025 madness, it can be easy to forget that LFW didn’t even exist before 1984, back when PR guru Lynne Franks had the galaxy-brained idea of putting together a schedule featuring the likes of Vivienne Westwood, Katharine Hamnett, and little-known Central Saint Martins graduate John Galliano. In the decades since, LFW has of course become a cultural behemoth, kickstarting and showcasing the careers of everyone from Simone Rocha to Martine Rose and Wales Bonner. But as we know, LFW isn’t just for fashion nerds, industry heads, and journos. Celebs love to be seen on the front row, and frankly we love to see them too. (Prior highlights include: Anna Wintour next to Queen Elizabeth II at Richard Quinn in 2018, Pamela Anderson next to a white statue at Vivienne Westwood in 2008 and all of the increasingly rare glimpses of Harry Styles). And with the likes of Harris Reed and CSM’s class of 2025 kicking us off on the Thursday, LFW has only just begun. To that end, scroll through the gallery below to see all the biggest stars in attendance at the fall winter 2025 edition of London Fashion Week.

Why Are We So Obsessed With Celebrity Court Style?,https://www.vogue.com/article/celebrity-court-fashion,"February 19, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Yesterday, A$AP Rocky was found not guilty in a felony assault trial. Over the course of the court proceedings—which spanned nearly four weeks—Rocky retained his reputation as one of the most stylish celebrities, showing up every day in impeccably tailored suits: pinstripes, trench coats, structured shoulders, and wide legs. He was so well-dressed—and in so much Saint Laurent—that his morning walks to the courthouse may as well have been an ad campaign. It wasn’t the first time the public has consumed—grimly or voyeuristically—what celebrities and people in the public eye wear to court, and it certainly won’t be the last. In September 2024, Justin Timberlake arrived at the Sag Harbor municipal court to plead guilty to driving while impaired, for which he was arrested in June. (The charge came with a 90-day license suspension, 25 hours of community service, and a $500 fine.) The incident was heavily memed thanks to reports that the arresting officer didn’t know who the singer was, which came to light mid-arrest when Timberlake muttered, “This is going to ruin the tour.” When asked what tour, he said, “The world tour.” With so much public attention on the case, Timberlake and his stylist, Jason Bolden, surely put consideration into his court attire. He wore a black crewneck T-shirt underneath a black V-neck cardigan with brown trousers, and leather shoes. But most surprising was his choice of accessory: a double strand of pearls. Timberlake has been wearing traditionally feminine jewelry lately, as have the likes of Harry Styles, Usher, Shawn Mendes, A$AP Rocky, and Pharrell Williams—a growing trend among male actors and musicians. The pearl necklace in particular has become a softboy-coded accessory. It’s also a relatively new symbol of Timberlake’s onstage persona. But is court really the place for an emblem of his popstar style? Others have taken different approaches to court style. In 2023, celebrities in the courtroom seem of more interest than ever, between the popularity of Jury Duty—which starred James Marsden as a satirized version of himself—Kim Kardashian doing her civic duty by reporting for her own jury duty, and Gwyneth Paltrow’s highly memed ski trial. In November 2023, the writer E. Jean Carroll was awarded $83.3 million after a jury found Donald Trump liable of defamation for disparaging statements he made in 2019, following claims that he sexually assaulted her. For her final day in court, Carroll stuck to her longtime outfit formula: a black turtleneck paired with a black pleated skirt; a white brocade blazer cinched with a black belt; opaque black stockings; and a cream overcoat. She carried with her a chestnut-colored briefcase. On this day of victory, Carroll opted for an eye-catching pair of black and white heeled Oxfords. The last time she wore this outfit was during her May 2023 trial against the former president, where he was also found liable for sexually assaulting and defaming her. The fascination with celebrity court style is far from new. In the fall of 2002, Winona Ryder appeared in court in a seemingly unassuming dress: a black long-sleeve with a pink and white trompe l’oeil collar and an A-line skirt that fell below the knee from Marc Jacobs’s fall 2001 collection. While the dress would generally be considered a perfectly demure court attire, it became an instant lightning rod for controversy. Ryder was on trial for shoplifting $5,500 of merchandise from Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills—Marc Jacobs clothing among the items stolen. The sheer audacity of the look, however, paid off: In May 2002, Ryder appeared on the cover of W in a “Free Winona” graphic tee, and even starred in Jacobs’s spring 2003 campaign. Celebrity trials are a way for many to see larger-than-life figures attempt to conduct themselves under pressure, some during the lowest moments of their lives. When famous people publicly contend with the fact that they are not above the law, their sartorial choices can go in a couple directions. Some opt for more modest, neutral clothing that seeks to humanize, making them seem respectful and serious; or they lean into their personae, dressing for the attention that they know they’re already bound to receive. Some don’t take well to the pressure. During a 2010 probation meeting and sentencing for missing counseling sessions related to her 2007 DUI, Lindsay Lohan wore a court-appropriate outfit of a black cowl neck, black trousers, peep-toe pumps, and a gray cardigan. But written over her nail polish on her middle finger was an expletive message. Others rise to the occasion. Earlier this year, Gwyneth Paltrow stood trial in Deer Valley, Utah, after she was sued for $300,000 by retired optometrist Terry Sanderson over a 2016 ski collision; Paltrow countersued for $1 and legal fees. (Sanderson was found at fault.) While the trial was largely considered a waste of time, Paltrow’s attire caught many people’s eyes. The Goop founder leaned into the après ski chic, wearing neutral sweaters, long pleated skirts, and sleek suits. With her expert tailoring and accessorizing, Paltrow’s stealth wealth wardrobe proved that court wear can be chic, too. Cardi B, however, ran in the opposite direction. While the rapper avoided the media circus of a trial by pleading guilty to two charges stemming from a strip club fight, she still had her day in court. For her arraignment, she wore a navy and pink suit with seemingly no undershirt, and carried a neon pink and white Birkin. Earlier this year after she failed to meet the requirements of her plea deal, she returned to court in a sweeping black feathered coat with a lengthy train, a white button-up with a skinny black tie, Louboutins, and an oversized fuzzy black hat. On another occasion, she opted for a tight white long-sleeved dress with white Louboutins, and a floor-length white fur coat. Some derided the looks as making a mockery of the justice system, while others deemed them instantly iconic—a display of Cardi B remaining unwaveringly true to herself. Courtroom style can make or break how a defendant is perceived by the judge, jury, and the court of public opinion, and celebrities know better than anybody about the power of perception. As Alexis Neiers knows all too well, the difference between $29 four-inch Bebe heels and six-inch Louboutins is astronomical. Paris Hilton pled guilty on two misdemeanors, drug possession and obstructing an officer. Naomi Campbell at her 2006 trial for second-degree assault after she allegedly threw a cell phone at her housekeeper. Martha Stewart carries a Birkin while on trial for obstruction of justice, 2004.

Behold! Every Taylor Swift Outfit From the 2024-2025 NFL Season,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/every-taylor-swift-outfit-2024-2025-nfl-season#intcid=_vogue-verso-hp-trending_920a9351-cae8-486c-a7ac-8b0b1cbd72ad_popular4-1,"January 26, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"It’s a Sunday evening in America, and that only means one thing: Taylor Swift is at the Kansas City Chiefs game. For the second season in a row, the singer is cheering on her boyfriend, Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce. Tonight, Swift was spotted attending the Chiefs-versus-Buffalo Bills game in a bold monogrammed Louis Vuitton look including a logo jacket, bag, and boots. Ever the supportive partner, Swift often comes decked out in team colors. On some occasions, she leans all the way into WAG territory (for the team’s game against the Bengals on September 15, she wore a Chiefs tee with thigh-high black boots), while on other nights she embraces her more high-fashion side, like the denim Versace corset top she wore for the game against the Baltimore Ravens. For a game against the New Orleans Saints, Swift turned out a full Vivienne Westwood ensemble, wearing an off-the-shoulder sweetheart corset and miniskirt in a matching gray-and-red tartan from fall 2024, which she paired with knee-high black leather platform boots and a small purse emblazoned with Westwood’s telltale orb insignia. (The corset has proven itself a particularly popular piece as of late: just last month former First Daughter Malia Obama also wore it to the Deauville Film Festival in France.) Beyond the fabulous fashion, she opted for a spirited beauty look, adding a smattering of glitter across her face to her signature red lip. Swift is also liable to mix sporty style with more fashion-forward elements. On the November 4 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, she paired her Kansas City leather jacket with a Dior Saddle bag and a Chanel necklace. On November 29, she stepped out for the Black Friday game in a red Louis Vuitton half-zip sweater, Dana Rebecca Designs hoops, and a custom “87” necklace in honor of Travis Kelce’s jersey number. Though, at the December 21 game against the Houston Texans, Swift channeled her inner Penny Lane (in Kansas City colors though, obviously) in a red shearling coat, which she styled with a black velvet vintage Chanel bucket hat. While we recognize the average Vogue reader may be a bit less invested in their fantasy football league than they are their fantasy creative director bracket, we can surely all appreciate the fashions that Swift brings to Kansas City. So, with that, follow along throughout the 2024-2025 NFL season as we chronicle every outfit Taylor Swift wears to cheer on the Kansas City Chiefs. Wearing a monogrammed Louis Vuitton jacket, bag, and shoes. Wearing a Charlotte Simone coat, vintage Chanel bucket hat, Tods bag, and Manolo Blahnik boots. In a Louis Vuitton half-zip sweater, Paige jeans, Dana Rebecca Designs hoops, and a custom “87” necklace. In a Chiefs jacket, corset top, knee-high Chrisitan Louboutin cowboy boots, Dior Saddle bag, and Chanel necklace. In Vivienne Westwood. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

Who Pays for the Wedding? A Guide to Cost-Splitting,https://www.vogue.com/article/who-pays-for-the-wedding-etiquette-rules#intcid=_vogue-verso-hp-trending_920a9351-cae8-486c-a7ac-8b0b1cbd72ad_popular4-1,"January 25, 2025",By Priya Rao,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Newly engaged? You’re probably ready to book a venue and buy a dream dress. But first, there’s one major question you have to address: who pays for the wedding? Determining your wedding budget is an essential first step in planning your celebration, but it's important to understand who can contribute to the costs of the day. While weddings were often paid by the couple's parents in the past, the tides have changed. “These days, anything goes when it comes to paying for a wedding. Engaged couples taking care of the finances is on the rise,” says Kylie Carlson, the CEO of the International Academy of Wedding & Event Planning. “At the same time, the tradition of the bride’s parents contributing is still very prevalent, especially in particular regions. With some weddings, costs are split between the couples and other members of the family. You’ll also run into scenarios where parents are divorced or remarried, and splitting the costs. Grandparents may chip in—it really does depend on each individual wedding.” When it comes to nuptials, it truly works on a case-by-case basis. As you navigate your own wedding, budget, and cost-splitting, here are some things to keep in mind as you figure out who pays for what. According to traditional wedding etiquette, the bride’s family assumes most of the financial costs associated with a wedding, including the wedding planner, invitations, dress, ceremony, reception, flowers, photography, and music. “It’s harder to think about this now—and I am a feminist—but historically it has to do with the ancient practice of a bride’s family giving a dowry to the groom for assuming the ‘burden’ of a bride,” says Lizzie Post, co-president of the Emily Post Institute (and the great-great-granddaughter of Emily Post). The bride’s parents also traditionally hosted the engagement party. The groom’s family traditionally paid for all costs associated with the rehearsal dinner and honeymoon, wedding day transportation, and the officiant. The groom also paid for the bride’s engagement ring, wedding ring, and groomsmen gifts. It is also common for the groom’s family to pay for the alcohol at the reception. Yet it’s important to remember this adage from Emily Post’s Wedding Etiquette guide: “Traditions make weddings special, and a spending plan should be something that facilitates these traditions, not a burden to be held against an old and outdated standard.” If certain family members are covering the majority of wedding costs, their contributions are traditionally noted on the invitations. “If the bride’s family is paying for the wedding, their name should come first and almost exclusively,” says Post. For example, the invitation would then begin with something like: “Dr. and Mrs. Arthur Smith request the honor of your presence at the wedding of their daughter Mary Ann to Everett Montgomery.” If both sets of parents are paying, you can opt for wording like: “Charles and Delaney Tout and Harold and Claudia Kohn invite you to celebrate with their children Amelia and Stephen.” Ahead, we break down the traditional breakdown of wedding costs. It's important to note that these traditions vary by the family's background. While Western weddings typically follow this division of financial responsibility, both Chinese and Russian cultures swap the standard with the groom's family paying for the majority of the wedding. For same-sex or non-binary couples, the rules are much more fluid. The wedding could be split evenly amongst the couple's families or be paid for by themselves. It is best for the bride and groom to have a private discussion first before speaking to their parents about helping to cover costs. “Please, please talk about costs up front,” says East Coast event expert Rebecca Gardner. Post agrees. She advises couples to then delicately broach the subject with family members. “It is best to phrase it as, ‘We were wondering if you would like to contribute to the wedding,’” Post suggests, adding that couples should emphasize that they are “not expecting anything.” If parents are willing to contribute, ask them to be clear about their expectations and what they are, or aren’t, willing to pay for. “Communication is key to keeping the peace. The last thing you want is a misunderstanding and you find yourself coming up short, or someone feeling like they need to contribute more than they expected,” adds Carlson. If your family is helping to significantly foot the bill, you might find yourself in tricky situations where they are insisting on their way rather than your way. If you can foresee that happening, you may want to consider taking care of the expenses yourself. “You’ll be far calmer having the wedding you want on your terms, even if you ultimately end up scaling back the festivities,” says Carlson. Today, more couples are directly contributing to the wedding. Simultaneously, more grooms’ families are also willing to split costs. Want specific statistics? According to a recent survey by The Knot, on average, parents contribute to 50% of the wedding budget, while couples pay the remaining half. Meanwhile, Zola found that one-third of couples are covering all of their wedding costs on their own. Curious if older couples are expected to pay more? “Age has very little to do with paying for the wedding,” says Carlson. “It’s really more about how financially sound the couple is on their own, as well as the role their family wants to play in the wedding.” Post agrees: “Age shouldn’t be a factor when contributing. Whether you are getting married in your 40s or 30s or 20s, a parent should want to help, as long as it is financially viable for them.” Wondering how to word invitations if the couple pays? If the bride and groom are paying for the wedding, then only their names need to be on the invite. If it is a combination of the couple and parents, something like the following works, according to Emily Post’s Etiquette Centennial: “Together with our families, Casey Collet and Felix Edgers invite you to join in celebrating their marriage.” In addition to the small duties of providing emotional support or searching for the groom's missing bowtie, a wedding party member may also be expected to contribute financially to a portion of the events. Traditionally, the wedding party will pay for their own personal attire and a gift for the couple. They are also expected to pay for their own travel to the wedding. In some cases, a couple and their families may help cover the costs of their lodging, but it's not expected. There also is the question of how the wedding party will contribute to other events. If invited to a shower, the attending wedding party member will be expected to bring a gift. A maid of honor may also pay for the costs of a bridal shower if she is hosting, or split the bill with one or multiple of the bride’s family members who offer to co-host. If attending a bachelor or bachelorette party, the wedding party member will be expected to pay for their travel and a portion of othe verall costs for the event. \ Forget Lake Como—Here’s Why You Should Visit the Charming Lake Lugano Instead The Biggest Color Trends in Interiors in 2025 I Stayed at the Hotel in The White Lotus Season 3—Here’s What It’s Really Like The Best Restaurants in Midtown Manhattan Never miss a Vogue moment and get unlimited digital access for just $2 $1 per month.

The Best Vintage Stores in Dallas Fort Worth,https://www.vogue.com/article/the-best-vintage-stores-in-dallas-fort-worth,"April 22, 2024",By Margaux Anbouba,"Vogue’s guide to the best vintage stores in Dallas/Fort Worth is part of our directory of the very best vintage around the world, curated by editors from all over. Whether you’re traveling and searching for some superb stores to visit on your trip or are curious about your local vintage treasure chests, Vogue’s directory has you covered. Thanks to Beyoncé, we're in a bit of a Texas renaissance. And while the Dallas/Forth Worth area is a fantastic place to find vintage Justin cowboy boots, authentic turquoise jewelry, and a rainbow of broken-in Levis, that's not all the city has to offer. The home of the first Neiman Marcus and a huge art scene has a long and storied history of loving fashion—and now, vintage lovers can reap the benefits. If you're into hitting up an estate sale (certainly worth it if one piques your interest), try any of these shops to find something of your own from The Big D. First, Caitlin Brax will look you up and down. Next, you'll do a little spin—and then Brax, known locally as “the denim whisperer,” will send you off to the dressing room with an arm full of Levis, Gloria Vanderbilts, and Wranglers (of course, it is Texas after all) that all remarkably just fit. Address: 2811 North Henderson Ave, Dallas You never know what you're going to find when you wander into this flea market-style store. Founded by Gretchen Bell in 2005, the first half of the shop is dedicated to racks upon racks of men's and women's clothing, all divided out by type and era—then further broken down into modern sizing—so it's easy to find what you're looking for. To the left, you'll find a large assortment of cowboy boots and smaller booths that are more like Pandora's (vintage) box: Velvet Elvis paintings, taxidermy mice wearing tutus, and leopard skin pillbox hats are just a few of the odd delights. Address: 1914 North Haskell Avenue, Dallas Located upon Dallas's “little sister” city, Denton's lively town square, this jewel box focuses on selling pieces of femme fatale history. There are 1940s peplum suits next to ‘80s Victor Costa gowns, Mad Men-style everything (down to the undergarments!), and a large assortment of accessories to complete every ensemble. With practically no online presence, your best bet is to just stop by—that's part of the vintage adventure. Address: 121 North Elm Street, Denton Founded by Daniel Brown in 2019, Nylo Wool is where the Marlboro man's closet has been curated for the next generation. You'll find it stocked with wares loved by true cowboys, like H Bar C pearl snap shirts, deeply broken-in overalls (patches included) from the 1940s, and an overall focus on plaid, flannels, and western wear that… is actual, authentically sourced from the west. Address: 3107 Commerce Street, Dallas Shop founder Katie White has an uncanny ability to pair prairie skirts with vintage Harley Davidson t-shirts in a way that has customers gravitating to this Bishop Arts shop in droves. Delicate lace dresses and handmade frocks, along with Gunne Sax everything, are frequently found on the racks, along with a large selection of coveralls and band tees. Through the back door, you'll find Brass Tacks Barber Shop, an old-school shop owned by White's husband, Brandon. Address: 330 West Davis Street, Suite #101, Dallas After spending 25 years wearing a law enforcement uniform, Studio 74 founder Laura Simmons is now going full-on technicolor. Her vibrant, western-inspired tastes are reflected in the store's stock. Inside the Forth Worth store you'll find hand-embroidered rodeo uniforms, dresses appropriate for chore work and debutant balls, and fringe—so much fringe. Address: 5926 Curzon Ave, Fort Worth Opened in 1999 by founders Ken Weber and Greg Kelly, this is really three shops in one: A well-stocked vintage store with garments from the 1800s onward; a consignment business with more modern finds like hard-to-find pieces from Chanel and Hermès previously loved by the city's well-heeled residents; and most recently, a dedicated men's store located next door.

The Best Vintage Stores in Milan,https://www.vogue.com/article/best-vintage-stores-in-milan,"April 22, 2024",By Selene Oliva,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Vogue’s guide to the best vintage stores in Milan is part of our directory of the very best vintage around the world, curated by editors from all over. Whether you’re traveling and searching for some superb stores to visit on your trip or are curious about your local vintage treasure chests, Vogue’s directory has you covered. Vintage lives outside the fashion universe—it exists beyond trends. It can represent a desire for renewal, the conversion of old to new, and, more poetically, adolescent reveries realized. There’s no greater satisfaction than buying the garment or accessory coveted in preteen years spent pouring over magazines. But where does the best vintage really live? Fashion capitals, of course. Milan is now a hotbed of vintage activity. Tucked away in picturesque urban postcards, behind Piazza Castello, or just a stone’s throw from the Columns of San Lorenzo, Milan’s vintage boutiques are a must-visit destination for those who experience fashion in Milan. To narrow down the city’s vintage highlights, we’ve assembled Vogue’s guide to the best vintage in Milan, curated with the help of our editors at Italian Vogue. You’ll find treasures in the cavernous wonders of Madame Pauline Vintage, a destination for vintage lovers and collectors of irreverent retro wares. Luring every generation with its offerings, the boutique is a must-visit address for both socialites and It girls and impeccable ladies of Milanese style—you know the types: silver hair, brooch on the chest, and heirloom bag on the wrist. With carefully selected offerings, the store also creates custom collections, including Bandana, a favorite among Madame’s most beloved frequenters. Address: Foro Buonaparte 74, 20121 Milan An institution for vintage treats and its archive fabrics, colors, and inspirations, Cavalli e Nastri is one of Milan's most celebrated vintage stores. The store is like a whirlwind fashion history tour from 1920s hats à la Louise Brooks to 1950s housemaid Corolle skirts to the unabashedly glamorous 1990s Versace. A Mecca for designers and stylists, the boutique has the intimacy you’d expect of a tea room with its soft music, shapes, and colors. Address: Via Gian Giacomo Mora, 3, 20123 Milan Located in a courtyard in old Milan and furnished with period furniture, Franco Jacassi’s Vintage Delirium opened in 1985 and has since become one of the world’s most extensive collections of vintage clothing. Beyond that, it’s also a trove for fashion researchers with its sizable selection of couture and vintage fabrics; the boutique features a fantastic button collection with more than 50,000 designs, as well as a true archive of magazines, buckles, antique appliqués, and much more. Address: Via Giuseppe Sacchi, 3, 20121 Milan Manuel Menini’s personal wunderkammer, Vincent Vintage Bijoux in Porta Venezia, holds an endless collection of vintage jewelry and costume jewelry, with a particular focus on the Georgian period. An ideal stop for jewelry aficionados, the boutique knows how to surprise with its theatrical displays that bring each individual piece to life. For those nostalgic for the Golden Age of jewelry, the store is the place for British and 19th-century styles. Address: Via Lazzaro Spallanzani, 11, 20129 Milan, tel. 3389743349 A destination for all those (of any age!) in their teenage rebellion phase Groupies is a nonconformist’s paradise. The shop focuses on street style, with an emphasis on the 1990s and 2000s. Between printed short-sleeved shirts and PVC bijoux straight out of our childhood manga dreams, it’s the perfect place to indulge in fun-filled shopping. Address: Via Gian Giacomo Mora, 7, 20123 Milan Tucked away in a side street of Piazza XXIV Maggio, PWC Milano is the location for club kids in Milan and beyond. The boutique’s assortment is consistent but not predictable, offering its coterie of loyal customers both the Cher Horowitz–inspired silk slip dress and the tie-dye prints to wear with black patent leather platform boots. The pièce de résistance is the accessories station, where Regency-style velvet bonnets and cloth brooches are merchandised alongside a total-leather look. Address: Via Pietro Custodi, 12, 20136 Milan Located somewhere between past and present on Corso Garibaldi, Lipstick Vintage has a flamboyant selection of ready-to-wear creations and endless accessories. Their wide assortment caters to everyone from the inconsolable romantic to the minimalists who refuse to wear color. The boutique offers its patrons muses of elegance, from the Mona Lisa to Cate Blanchett, and suggestions to mimic their style. Address: Corso Garibaldi, 79, 20121 Milan Much more than a vintage store; at Bivio, you can buy and sell your designer pieces. The store’s buyers buy exclusively from individuals, selecting pieces one by one and offering the seller the double option of receiving cash or a coupon to spend at the boutique—which wouldn’t be difficult to do. Address: Via Gian Giacomo Mora 4, 20123 Milan Just a stone’s throw from the art and design hub of Via Ventura, 20134Lambrate found its home beneath a 1940s barbershop sign. It’s the address to know if your wardrobe tends to mish-mash era; inside, 20th-century garments are shown on a mannequin adorned with 1980s accessories. And since fashion-lovers tend to love beauty in all its forms, there's a color-filled selection of furniture and furnishings such as lamps, chairs, vases, and mirrors. Address: Via Conte Rosso, 22, 20134 Milan Though it opened in the 1990s, stepping into Lo Specchio di Alice is not unlike stepping into Lewis Carroll’s looking glass—only here, you’re in a world where the 1960s never ended. Shoppers will fashion memorabilia from the past, from Cherokee belts to hand-painted bomber jackets, from twist-dancing shoes to biker boots. It’s a space for true explorers—customers could spend hours searching for the perfect purchase among hundreds and hundreds of offerings. Address: Corso di Porta Ticinese, 64, 20123 Milan Humana (also shoppable online) sees vintage as a way to live sustainably, but the store does much more than offer secondhand clothes—Humana is, in fact, a humanitarian organization founded in 1998 which (through the sale of its secondhand clothes) supports education, sustainable agriculture, health protection, and community development projects in Italy and beyond. The stores are filled with clothing, accessories, jewelry, and Italian fashion items from the ’60s to the present day. Address: Via Cappellari, 3, 20123 Milan Opened in 2010 and located in the Navigli district, Sous Vintage takes the concept of second-hand to the next level, offering not only pre-loved clothing and accessories but also hosting collections and events by young indie creatives who upcycle discarded fabrics and materials to create something new. The shop was the brainchild of Eva Fiorucci and Carolina Ferrari. Address: Alzaia Naviglio Pavese, 52, 20143 Milan More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

The Best Vintage Stores in São Paulo,https://www.vogue.com/article/best-vintage-stores-in-sao-paulo,"April 22, 2024",By Lilah Ramzi,"Vogue’s guide to the best vintage stores in São Paulo is part of our directory of the very best vintage around the world, curated by editors from all over. Whether you’re traveling and searching for some superb stores to visit on your trip or are curious about your local vintage treasure chests, Vogue’s directory has you covered. Is vintage what you think about when you think of São Paulo? It very well should be! The city is leading the secondhand and archival scene in Brazil—and South America, for that matter—with a handful of stores that satisfy a variety of vintage flights of fancy. For those looking for an emporium of theatrical vintage fashion, there is a store for that (head to Casa Juisi). If you’re less interested in older fashion and looking for more recent designer labels, there are plenty of superb options for that too (see Pretty New and Take Me Vintage.) If you enjoy the hunt and sifting through boutiques that offer a combination of the two, then Frou Frou is the store for you. It’s a fashionable choose-your-own-adventure, and to help you narrow it down, we’ve compiled a list of the best vintage stores in São Paulo, curated with the help of our editors at Vogue Brazil. Founded in 2007 by Paula Rondon and Gil França, B. Luxo is stocked with vintage pieces collected from around the world. It is a destination for no-label vintage, predominantly from the ’60s, ’70s, and ’80s. Inside the store, there are wunderkammers filled with antique jewelry, glass bell jars containing vintage accessories, and a fair amount of taxidermy birds adding to the fashion cabinet-of-curiosity vibes. The mood carries over online, where a superb selection of their wares is listed for sale. Address: R. Augusta, 2294 - Sala 22 - Cerqueira César, São Paulo - SP, 01412-100 Introducing Casa Juisi, a São Paulo institution that has long lured fashion history buffs and vintage enthusiasts to the city’s center. Here, you’ll find archival gems like Moschino’s silverware-laden jacket from 1989 and nautical ’80s fashions by Zandra Rhodes, but also American marching band costumes, theatrical opera gowns, and more. It’s a hodgepodge assortment with a common denominator of fabulousness. Address: R. Roberto Simonsen, 108 - Sé, São Paulo - SP, 01017-020 Founded in 2007 by mother-and-daughter duo Luzia Belucci and Giovanna Belucci, Frou Frou Vintage is a collection of vintage and secondhand products they’ve sourced from around the globe. Its mission is to promote the second (and third!) lives of all their pieces through affordably priced pieces for sale or rent. Inside, you’ll find a delightful mix of styles—disco balls hang from the ceiling, Persian rugs line the floors, and hats fill up every available space on the walls. Assortment-wise, it’s half thrift store and half designer vintage; shop pieces from the ’70s, ’80s, ’90s, and ’00s by Courrèges, Prada, Glória Coelho, Huis Clos, Reinaldo Lourenço, Bottega Veneta, Cacharel, Comme des Garçons, and more. Address: R. Augusta, 725 - 2 - Consolação São Paulo - SP, 01305-100 This store’s name, Minha Avó Tinha (meaning “My Grandmother Had” in Portuguese), sums things up perfectly. This is not your label-laden vintage store but a collection of early 20th-century pieces that your grandmother just might have actually hand. This Art Deco jewelry, lace shirting, woolen A-line skirts, boxy-shouldered blazers. All of this is displayed alongside vintage decor and furniture that adds to the ambiance but is also for sale. It had all the charm of a thrift store but all the presentation (and organization!) of a high-end designer vintage salon. Address: R. Tomé de Souza, 100 - Lapa, São Paulo - SP, 05079-000 For secondhand designer fashion, New4another is a well-stocked boutique and e-boutique frequented by São Paulo’s fashion crowd. The store, which is decorated in shades of sage green, is pristinely organized with shoes, accessories, wallets, and clothing galore in excellent condition. You won't find vintage-vintage here but you will find a great, barely-worn Zimmermann dress you can wear to your next outing. Address: R. Campo Verde, 61 - Conj 72 - Jardim Europa São Paulo - SP, 01456-010 Colors! Texture! Mood! And we're not even talking about the clothes. Pretty New’s punchy boutique is a delight to visit. The HQ for a second-hand resale site is stocked with high-end labels—in this one corner, you'll clock Loewe, Balenciaga, Chanel, Veronica Beard, and more. Founded by Gabriella Constantino Leal in 2014, the store is curated with current-season trends, and there's even a never-worn but not new section. It's the next best thing—better?—to shopping firsthand fashion in SP. Address: Av. Nove de Julho, 4865 - Jardim Paulista, São Paulo - SP, 01407-200 Conveniently located in a shopping mall behind a nondescript wooden door (IYKYK), Take Me Vintage is a sprawling emporium for secondhand designer fashions. Shoppable in-store and online, Take Me Vintage is more designer-secondhand than vintage, but there are plenty of runway pieces and heirlooms in the making up for grabs. Clothing is organized by color and vibe, and the shoes playfully line the store, winding all the way up the sets to the upper floor. Address: Shopping Cidade Jardim Av.

The Best Vintage Stores in Beirut,https://www.vogue.com/article/best-vintage-stores-in-beirut,"April 22, 2024",By Lilah Ramzi,"Vogue’s guide to the best vintage stores in Beirut is part of our directory of the very best vintage around the world, curated by editors from all over. Whether you’re traveling and searching for some superb stores to visit on your trip or are curious about your local vintage treasure chests, Vogue’s directory has you covered. Beirut has long been on the fashion map—Elie Saab, Zuhair Murad, Sandra Mansour, Georges Chakra, need we say more? But it's a city that's also at the forefront of all things vintage fashion. Across the seaside town, you'll find a variety of vintage, second-hand, and thrift shops to visit, from the label-laden GarageLuxe to the gorgeously curated vintage store Nouvelle Vague Vintage. And given Beirut is also known for its thriving nightlife—it needs to be experienced to be believed—there are shops like Depot-Vente filled with pieces to help get you dressed for the part. Below, our guide to the best vintage stores in Hong Kong, curated with the help of our editors at Vogue Arabia. Established in 2013, GarageLuxe describes itself as Lebanon's first major online consignment network. A decade later, the company (which uses the term “re-commerce”) has expanded and opened a glossy brick-and-mortar in Beirut's tony Achrafieh Mall. The resale platform is filled with labels and archival secondhand fashion (don't expect too much “vintage”) from all the top labels—you'll find Chanel, Hermès, and Dior bags galore. Address: ABC Achrafieh Mall, Level L1, STR 2065, Alfred Naccache, Beirut Set in Beirut's nightlife quarter of Gemmayze, you'll find a white neon sign calling you into Nouvelle Vague Vintage, which was founded by vintage collector Tatiana Fayad. The goal? To democratize vintage fashion across the Middle East—Fayad is never not picking merchandise for her store. Expect decades-old designer pieces that are incredibly well-priced and covetable. There is also no-label vintage from the ’60s, ’70s, and beyond that will tickle the fancy of any vintage lover. Address: 268 Gouraud Street, Gemmayze, Beirut “Pls note we don’t buy clothes from individuals, and don’t accept items on consignment,” reads the Instagram bio of Depot-Vente. Read: This is not your typical re-sale shop. Founded in 2013 in Nawal Akl, Depot-Vente is a premiere vintage shop located in Beirut’s hip Mar Mikhael neighborhood. This depot-style store does indeed feel like a depot, only it's stocked with vintage pieces from the ’60s all the way to 2000s. There's a look that Akl also considered when sourcing her pieces—youthful club and party-ready pieces ready for a night out. Address: Khalil Badawi, Beirut Vintage Soul 101 isn't in Beirut—it's technically just north in Jounieh. It's also not a vintage store, per se, but it's still worth adding to a list of vintage stores since it carries both secondhand and upcycled pieces (bags, tops, and more) made from deadstock fabrics. You can find vintage fashion capital F (Givenchy blazers; Escada jackets), but the draw here is really the upcycled and pieced-together separates that mish fabrics together brilliantly. Address: Vintage Soul 101, Sarba Second Base is a charity thrift shop created in 2017 by FabricAID, one of Lebanon’s leading social enterprises, which collects and redistributes clothes to disadvantaged communities throughout the country. They fund their mission with the sales of their “vintage, hipster, revealing, and extroverted clothing items” out of a storefront in Beirut.

The Best Vintage Stores in Tokyo,https://www.vogue.com/article/best-vintage-stores-in-tokyo,"April 22, 2024",By Margaux Anbouba,"Vogue’s guide to the best vintage stores in Tokyo is part of our directory of the very best vintage around the world, curated by editors from all over. Whether you’re traveling and searching for some superb stores to visit on your trip or are curious about your local vintage treasure chests, Vogue’s directory has you covered. A trip to Tokyo is a bucket-list item for many, especially if you love designer vintage. Strict anti-counterfeit laws make it a dream for those looking to purchase rare bags from the Marc Jacobs era of Louis Vuitton, perfectly pristine Chanel tweed suits, or even an Hermès Birkin bag (there are many stores completely dedicated to them)—but there’s also the Americana movement currently happening there, which has made brands like Carhartt, Doc Martens, and Tommy Hilfiger in high demand. As the scene continues to grow, so will this list. But here’s where to start with the best vintage stores in Tokyo curated with the help of our editors at Vogue Japan. Beloved by celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Black Pink, and Vogue’s very own Christian Allaire, this is a must-stop destination for designer handbags, accessories, and clothing. We suggest making an appointment so you can skip the line—after that, there’s two ways to approach an appointment: Come with dream bag in mind (Casanova’s selection of rare Chanels is particularly fantastic) or with an open mind and go home with something unexpected. Address: 〒150-0001 Tokyo, Shibuya City, Jingumae, 5 Chome−12−10 鈴木ハイツ １F Pristine Hermès scarves, costume jewelry, and trench coats of every color are just a few of the vintage selects you’ll find in this casual shop. Down the block, there’s sister shop Vini Vini Luxe, which focuses on higher end items. Address: Japan,〒150-0034 Tokyo, Shibuya City, Daikanyamacho, 12−19 第３横芝ビル 3F Half vintage, half contemporary, this shop stocks clothing with an edge (and in shades of black, gray, and white). Mainly focused on items designed for men, there are vintage pulls from Japanese designers like Comme des Garçons and Undercover, along with Dior Homme, Jil Sander, Prada, Miu Miu, and more. Address: Factory_01 B1F, 2-31-2 Jingumae, Shibuyaku, Tokyo 1500001 Part tailor, part vintage shop, this store’s offerings—yes, mostly dresses—are on display as if each piece is part of a museum exhibit. The benefit of the two-in-one is that each garment by designers like Yves Saint Laurent, Nina Ricci, and Louis Feraud has been carefully inspected before it goes up for sale, so no pesky pinholes or dropped hems remain. Another bonus is if it needs a little tailoring to become a perfect fit, the shop can help. Address: 22-4 Sarugakucho, Shibuya City, Tokyo More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

Mikey Madison Is the 2025 Awards Season’s Fashion Darling,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/mikey-madison-fashion-darling-anora,"February 21, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Mikey Madison is the talk of the town. The 25-year-old actor is the center of (deserved) awards buzz thanks to her ferocious performance in Anora as Ani, a Brighton Beach dancer and sex worker who impulsively marries Vanya (Mark Eydelshteyn), the young, foolhardy son of Russian oligarchs. While Madison—who people may also recognize from Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood, Scream, and Better Things—is a rising star in Hollywood, she’s also growing her profile in the fashion world. With help from stylist Jamie Mizrahi—who also works with the likes of Jennifer Lawrence, Adele, Riley Keogh, and Jeremy Allen White—the young actor has leveled up her style game. A Chanel darling during the Cannes Film Festival, Madison wore haute couture on the Croisette. (Consider it a good luck charm: Anora wound up taking home the Palme D’or.) Since then, she’s mastered movie star glamour in an open-back black velvet Prada dress embellished with scattered crystals, and a black drop-waist Rodarte with a tiered tulle skirt. But she’s also used her press tour to prove she isn’t afraid of taking risks, like when she wore a sexy Saint Laurent suit or a Chanel tweed short suit. Saving the best for last, she wore the Schiaparelli spring 2024 finale look (as worn on the runway by Kendall Jenner): a curve-hugging midi dress covered in red faux fingernails to the New York premiere. Madison kicked off the race to the Oscars in a red custom Prada, and dabbled in haute couture in a black Schiaparelli skirt and bra set at the Gotham Awards. For the 2025 Golden Globes, the first of the major awards shows, she wore one of Matthieu Blazy’s last custom Bottega Veneta dress: a gold scaly strapless number. Since then, she’s continued a hot-streak of custom looks, usually in black, white, or red (with some occasional gold, for good measure). Still, even with a lean color palette, the looks are never anything short of thrilling, from her backless red Simone Rocha dress to the drapey Proenza Schouler with surprise hip cutouts. This is just the start of Mikey Madison as a fashion force. Follow along throughout awards season to keep up with her rising star. In Prada at the Universal Focus Features DWA BAFTA celebration. In custom Prada at the BAFTAs. In Chanel at the Charles Finch & Chanel Pre-BAFTA Party. In Proenza Schouler at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. Wearing The Row at the DGA Awards.

Bella Hadid Folds Vintage Dolce & Gabbana Into Her Cowgirl Wardrobe,https://www.vogue.com/article/bella-hadid-vintage-dolce-and-gabbana-cowgirl-wardrobe,"February 21, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Bella Hadid will never run out of ways to incorporate cowboy boots into an outfit. Last night, the model celebrated her new collaboration with Frankie’s Bikinis at Stella West Hollywood, where she added some cowgirl flair to her look. Hadid wore a black long-sleeve tee and matching black button-up micro shorts. In something of an update to the 2000s Juicy Couture tracksuit, both her shirt and shorts were emblazoned with “Lucky” in red cursive across her chest and backside. Adding to the look was was a pair of sepia lensed pilot sunglasses from Chanel’s fall 2024 collection. But still a cowgirl through and through, Hadid managed to bring a Western element with a pair of four-and-a-half-inch heeled boots from Dolce & Gabbana featuring a butterfly motif across the toe and shaft. The boots hail from the brand’s now-defunct offshoot label D&G geared toward a younger demographic, likely their spring 2004 collection. Hadid always manages to nod to the rodeo with her outfits, whether she’s rocking a pair of chaps, or offering more subtle tributes with fringed suede bags and Western belt buckles. While her towering Dolce & Gabbana boots definitely aren’t suitable for horseback riding or cutting competitions, Bella Hadid will always find a way to honor her inner cowgirl. Yeehaw!

Though she has no shortage of high-octane looks—ranging from glamorous full-length coats paired with jeans to skintight LBDs—the Fenty founder chose to match with her partner, A$AP Rocky, in coordinating Saint Laurent suiting looks. For her birthday dinner, Rih wore a brown double-breasted blazer with peak lapels and structured shoulders, a white button-up, and slim black trousers. She added a feminine touch to the menswear-inspired outfit with a black leather shoulder bag, extreme pointy-toe pumps, and a berry lip. But two of Rihanna’s accessories were a perfect match with Rocky’s: a burgundy necktie with thin diagonal stripes and a pair of chunky black Ray-Bans. (The glasses were no accident. Today, Rocky was announced as the first-ever creative director for Ray-Bans, with their first collaboration expected in spring.) Rocky stuck to his usual suiting for the occasion. He also opted for a double-breasted blazer—his in gray—over a white button-up and a pair of black trousers. But he chose to add an additional layer, wearing a light khaki gabardine trench coat over his suiting. The rapper has gained attention for his Saint Laurent-heavy suiting as of late. Earlier this week, Rocky was found not guilty in a felony assault trial. During the nearly month-long proceedings, his court style consisted of impeccably tailored suiting—much like what he wore to Rihanna’s birthday dinner. Now, with his recent not guilty verdict, he reminds us that his suiting was not just for show, but rather is consistent with his wardrobe year-round. While suiting isn’t exactly what first comes to mind for couple style, Rihanna and A$AP Rocky are making a very strong case for doubling up on menswear. Plus, they can help each other tie their ties!

Gen Z Deserves an Hervé Léger Bandage Dress Revival,https://www.vogue.com/article/gen-z-herve-leger-bandage-dress-revival,"February 21, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"When Kaia Gerber attended the Toronto International Film Festival premiere of her film Shell, she sought out a designer who isn’t as common on the red carpet nowadays: Hervé Léger. The model wore a white full-length bandage dress, a recreation of her mother Cindy Crawford’s 1993 Oscars look. “Kaia had sent me a mood board for TIFF and this was one of her references,” Molly Dickson, who styled Gerber for the event, told Vogue. While Gerber was paying homage to her supermodel mom, it did give the label a moment in the sun for a new generation. Even for the eldest Gen Z-ers, the French brand’s trademark bodycon silhouette felt out of reach, falling out of fashion before we reached an appropriate age to wear them. “Hervé Léger is the ’90s supermodel second-skin,” Liana Satenstein, host of Neverworns and former Vogue writer says of the dress’s appeal. And, as she wrote in 2022, “an Hervé bandage dress acts as a bra for your whole body—holding you perfectly in place.” Rihanna at the 2007 Clive Davis Pre-Grammys Party. Blake Lively as Serena van der Woodsen on Gossip Girl, 2009. The dress persisted beyond the ’90s supermodel era, reaching the early days of Kardashian fame, teen soap operas, and Transformer movies. As my Millennial colleagues regale the Gen Z staffers with tales about hitting the club in a form-fitting Hervé Léger number, I can’t help but feel a pang of FOMO. But beyond Gerber, it seems that the younger generation is bandage dress-curious. On TikTok, young people who missed the boat last time around are creating a new wave of interest. One video with over 116,000 likes reads, “pov: your [sic] born in 2001 but now your [sic] old enough to own a herve leger dress.” Another proclaimed she was “feeling soooo serena van der woodsen,” referring to a dress that Blake Lively wore on Gossip Girl. With a cycle of nostalgia-driven trends, it’s no surprise that the bandage dress would reincarnate. “Today, there is an overwhelming sensual mood in the air and a thirst for going out,” Satenstein says. During a recent live shopping installment of Neverworns, she included a rainbow gradient dress with white piping by Léger, which she says “felt right for the world.” It was purchased before the evening was over. My colleague Margaux Anbouba, Vogue’s senior beauty and wellness editor, told me of her bandage dress days, “Hervé Léger saw me through some of my brightest and boldest moments of the aughts. At the time, I don’t think I had ever felt more powerful than when I put on a bandage dress—the sucked in sausage casing effect was perfect for my favorite pastime of that era, dancing in the club.” May the members of Gen Z get to experience that same joy that only a bandage dress can provide.

"It’s Time to Update Your Trench Coat, Per Stars Like Rihanna and Hailey Bieber",https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/modern-trench-coats-celebrity-winter-trend,"February 20, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. It’s currently peak coat season, and celebrities are slipping into their best statement outerwear to keep warm. What has been a hit amongst the A-list trendsetters recently? Elegant draped coats and plushy shearlings have been spotted on stars like Kendall Jenner and Ayo Edebiri. But for those in the less-frigid settings, a more lightweight coat has been taking off: Meet the modernized trench coat. At first glances these Rihanna and Hailey Bieber-approved coats may look like your average khaki trenches. But lean in a little closer to notice the details, and you’ll find a bevy of refreshing updates—be it the silhouette, the prints, or the fabrics—that give the trench coat a 2025-worthy feel. Leather trenches, whether in classic black or luxurious chocolate brown, have been one such way to make the wardrobe staple feel current. Rihanna paired hers with fitted snakeskin knee boots, while Anya Taylor-Joy wore a belted style with a chunky turtleneck sweater underneath. Gugu Mbatha-Raw also embraced a statement trench via a checkered Burberry version. If a lightweight cotton or twill treatment is more your speed, celebrities such as Mikey Madison and Monica Barbaro—two awards season darlings this year—have embraced the classic khaki trench in new shapes. With details like extra-slouchy fits or asymmetrical lapels, their reworked coats have just enough visual interest to make them feel new and exciting—without ever going out of style. But that’s the beauty of a trench, isn’t it? No matter if you go for a bold or subtle style, it will forever be a timeless hero piece that you can mix and matched. So, do like the stars and go for one that has some extra pizazz. As Nicki Minaj once said, “who wants to look simple when you could look stunning?” Below, see more modern approaches to the trench coat.

Kendall Jenner and Ayo Edebiri Inspired My Draped Outerwear Obsession,https://www.vogue.com/article/kendall-jenner-ayo-edebiri-draped-outerwear,"February 19, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"This past New York Fashion Week, you couldn’t walk five feet without seeing a draped scarf jacket. But the look is spanning well past the streets of Manhattan and the runways. Celebrities like Kendall Jenner and Ayo Edebiri are also embracing the effortless outerwear. Jenner has been a documented fan of the scarf jacket since late 2023, when she showed off her Phoebe Philo caped bomber in Los Angeles. Later that week, she wore a buttery leather Bottega Veneta trench coat, a matching scarf draped across her chest. Jenner’s fondness for the two-in-one look persisted, to the point where she was among NYFW’s many scarf jacket enthusiasts. After walking in the Calvin Klein Collection’s revival show, the model cloaked herself in a sage green top from The Row, adding some dynamism to her classic cropped white tee and trousers. Kendall Jenner leaving the Calvin Klein Collection fall 2025 show on Feb. 7. Edebiri modeled the look—also in The Row—at the premiere of her film Opus at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival. The actor wore a chartreuse midi dress with a matching coat that she draped over her elbow with a pair of ladylike ankle-strap heels. Ayo Edebiri at the 2025 Sundance Film Festivall, Jan. 27. It’s no surprise that the look is spiking in popularity this winter. The Toteme scarf jacket reached cult status in 2023. But with Calvin Klein, Kallmeyer, and Brandon Maxwell all showing the drapey silhouette on the runway this season‚ plus the endorsement from two high-octane dressers like Kendall Jenner and Ayo Edebiri—we can safely assume that the trend is just beginning.

I Need Celebrities to Stop Changing Clothes Every Five Seconds,https://www.vogue.com/article/i-need-celebrities-to-stop-changing-clothes-every-five-seconds,"February 14, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Last week, Anya Taylor-Joy spent the day running around New York City to promote her forthcoming film The Gorge. In one day alone, the actor wore five separate outfits—ranging from a sensational Alexander McQueen shearling coat to a mod Celine skirt suit and a brown leather Loewe trapeze jacket. Taylor-Joy is far from the only celebrity to change outfits at light speed: Keke Palmer, Blake Lively, and Sydney Sweeney have all recently churned out scores of looks in a short amount of time. Beyond street style, awards shows and red carpets have become an opportunity for outfit changes galore. At the Grammys, Doechii and Chappell Roan were among the artists to switch up their looks—Doechii in a parade of custom Thom Browne, Roan in a series of rodeo clown-inspired outfits. Recently, the speed at which celebrities change clothing seems to be reaching terminal velocity. Sure, there is a logic behind this phenomenon: they are usually in the throes of a press tour, taping junkets, talk shows, and social spots on a condensed timeline. Changing outfits offers the illusion that celebrities have more hours in the day than the rest of us, that they can fulfill endless professional obligations. Why, after all, would we want to know that an actor did GMA, a Buzzfeed puppy interview, and Hot Ones all in the same day? That would shatter the fantasy of promotional work as breezy and fun. Meanwhile, when it comes to awards shows, a roster of outfit changes can tell a story and convey power, something both Doechii and Chappell Roan executed at the Grammys. Both singers, nominated for Best New Artist, pulled off major fashion flexes in what the Recording Academy considers their freshman year: Roan changed from archival Jean Paul Gaultier couture into custom Thom Browne, while Doechii rocked four custom looks (also by Browne) over the course of the evening. But, be it street style or red carpet dressing, constantly changing outfits dilutes the power of the fashion. One can only imagine all of the time and effort that goes into making or procuring a garment—sourcing, shipping, tailoring—just for it to be worn for only a few minutes. It also causes red carpet moments to lose their salience. After all, who cares what a celebrity is wearing on the red carpet when we know they’re about to head inside and change? It’s not a problem contained to the fashion industry. We as a culture have a voracious appetite for newness, constant stimulation. But this ecosystem of nonstop changing is wildly unsustainable in terms of the environment, labor, and time. Going forward, celebrities and their stylists would be better served curating fashion moments that promote quality over quantity. After all, we only have so many hours in the day: why waste it changing every hour when one great look is all it takes?

New York Fashion Week Street Style Embraced a Ladylike Agenda—7 Outfits to Re-create,https://www.vogue.com/article/new-york-fashion-week-looks-fw25,"February 13, 2025",By Cortne Bonilla,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. The fall 2025 New York Fashion Week shows have officially ended, and the city-dwelling street style scene is always one to watch. I mean, who does New York better than New Yorkers? Amid what felt like an eternity of larger-than-life silhouettes, it seems a new sartorial tide has turned. While you’ll never not see oversized shapes and head-to-boot monochromatic looks, a demure and sophisticated approach dominated the streets of Manhattan and Brooklyn: ladylike dressing. Structured jackets (some collarless, some cinched at the waist) first arrived on the scene last spring, and now we’re seeing these feminine sensibilities influence other categories. Showgoers embraced the modern lady, taking cues from the past with long leather gloves peeking out from elegant outerwear or affixed onto belts, brooches pinned to jacket lapels, and an array of silk scarves to add a burst of color and lightweight warmth (it’s still winter!). For an easy transition into the new season, there are a plethora of ladylike goodies—and styling tips—to take from the NYFW scene. From fitted coats and classic blazers to leather gloves, skinny belts, and more, here are our favorite street style looks to re-create from the uptown-meets-downtown-meets-Brooklyn crowd. Just when you think New York couldn’t get any gloomier, an eruption of vivid color emerges onto the scene.

A Moment For the Cool Model-Off-Duty Looks From NYFW,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/best-model-off-duty-looks-nyfw-fall-2025,"February 11, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"The new fall 2025 collections, debuted during New York Fashion Week, were not the only exciting looks to take in this week. Off the catwalk, the street style scene put forward interesting new outfit propositions as well—be it via great coats, new It bags, or statement hosiery. And while this season’s crop of well-clad showgoers mostly consisted of celebrities, editors, and VIP influencers, the participating models—dashing from one show to the next—also delivered their own fashion flavor. This week’s shows served as a true hub for impeccable model-off-duty style, as there is something effortlessly cool about the way models put outfits together in between gigs. Sure, their own outfits often different drastically from the new designs they sport on the runway, but they sometimes strike similar notes of elegance and trendiness. Take model of the moment Alex Consani, who was spotted in an oversized cream sweater and slouchy leather boots, or runway regular Paloma Elsesser, who paired calf-length leggings with a cropped leather bomber. Other supermodels, like Kendall Jenner, opted for statement accessories to keep warm during the week—like a jaunty hat and scarf. While the looks were built for function and coziness while on-the-go—they were also perfect for the awaiting street style photographers crowing around pre-and-post show. This is NYFW, after all: one must be camera-ready at all times. In need of some winter style inspiration? Look no further than to the models who made the streets of New York their personal runway.

In Perfect Step: A Maison Margiela and Christian Louboutin Collaboration Inspired By One Magical Collection,https://www.vogue.com/article/in-perfect-step-a-maison-margiela-and-christian-louboutin-collaboration-inspired-by-one-magical-collection,"February 21, 2025",By Hamish Bowles,"Christian Louboutin first remembers John Galliano 40 years ago, making his first, tentative steps in Paris, the city of dreams, the city of fashion. “He was an excited English fashion student, but also very, very excited by Paris,” Louboutin recalls, “He was always saying, ‘I love Paris, and Paris loves me!’ And Paris really loved him.” John Galliano had rather despaired of his London life. The ’80s had been a glorious, carefree, wild decade, but those heady days were coming to an end. AIDS was rearing its terrible head, and heroin cast a pall. Fashion in London was tough. His backers withdrew their support. But Galliano knew that in Paris his fantasies would somehow become realities. There, he slept on friends’ sofas and ate beans on toast as he chased this elusive dream. Louboutin recalls that “he was a very joyful, happy person.” Galliano was swept up in the Paris world. And it treated him royally, for a time. But in spite of this love and their friendship, Louboutin and Galliano had never collaborated in a serious way before on a collection. Of course they had collaborated on individual models for specific clients (for instance, Louboutin did the shoes for Kate Moss’s 2011 wedding—the dress, a memorably 1930s fairy tale by John Galliano for Margiela). The Maison Margiela x Christian Louboutin collaboration. That is, until “one day I had lunch with John and Alexis [Roche, his partner], and he said, out of the blue, ‘Would you consider doing something with me?’ And immediately I said ‘Yes of course!’ John was very, very happy. And suddenly he was a shower of ideas. This was a milestone in his story because he was so, so, so, into it. He was drowned by it, and so excited and so precise, and so full of his creative energy.” Galliano “always loved shoes but he’s never made them,” as Louboutin explains, so he has assembled key figures who have brought their skills to the medium, “and I’m very happy and proud to be one of them,” adds Louboutin. “You know, it’s funny when you work. We worked almost a year ahead, and it was very complicated—because his clothes are incredibly complicated to do because of the faux cul [the false bottom] and so on. Everything was on a level of couture that is almost never reached.” Ultimately, the show was a triumph; a swansong for John Galliano’s extraordinary decade at Maison Margiela. “It was of a perfection,” says Louboutin, “that evening, with the drizzle under the bridge.” The show was held under the Pont Alexandre III bridge in Paris, where Galliano had conjured a sort of thread bare 1930s boite. It was a Brassai moment, with Pat McGrath’s extraordinary second skin, shining face masks. “Even if I was expecting something which was going to be great, I was not necessarily ready to have such a vision of such an impactful show. It’s one thing that you can expect from very, very few designers, and you can expect this from him,” says Louboutin. “The level of emotion involved in the show, not only in the clothes, but in the show itself: it was a really magical moment. You know, it's poetry and magic. Even just talking about it makes me emotional! It took 40 years of John Galliano to make me cry at a show,” remembers Louboutin. “…And the shoes!” So now, taking a deep breath after the show of shows, Louboutin has worked on a second collection for Maison Margiela, the silhouettes drawn from the show. They have outlined a few stores, “So they will be sold at Margiela and they will be sold at Louboutin!” he exults. “Ever since I've known John,” Louboutin continues, “he has a kind of passion for tribal clothes, [clothes] from plays, from dance, from Kabuki. His brain is built boiling around that anyway.” A look from the Maison Margiela spring 2024 couture—and Louboutin’s high heeled version of the Tabi. There are outrageous high heels, and foot-to-the-ground flats, all with the Tabi, the toe separator, off setting the glamour of the Louboutins. (Although it’s made in a whole new way, more couture and less homespun than the Margiela originals). There are also wedding shoes, with a twist. “The idea was almost like a game to play with the codes of two houses, Margiela and Louboutin. With Margiela you have deconstruction. I would call it ‘creative minimalism’ for Margiela. And for my DNA, it is almost a classical vision of femininity, a sexy femininity. So basically, for me to bring Margiela into my world."" So in a white high-heeled Tabi shoe with a streak of red paint down the heel, one can see the worlds of Margiela and Louboutin colliding. “I think it's probably the perfect marriage!” laughs Louboutin.

A Rare Ashley Olsen Sighting Provides a Lesson in Ultimate High-Low Dressing,https://www.vogue.com/article/ashley-olsen-high-low-dressing-nike-trainers-margaux-bag,"February 21, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Hark, the first glimpse of an Olsen in 2025! It’s Ashley Olsen, Olsening in a way only she and Mary-Kate can. (Despite the copycats and The Row flatterees.) Photographed out in New York City, The Row founder was seen running errands in a long-line black puffer jacket, a gnome-like black beanie (both she and her sister are fans of tall headgear), a checked scarf, and black track pants tucked into grey marl socks. On her feet, she wore Nike V2K Run Sneakers—a sporty, out-of-step footwear choice for Olsen, who often opts for a ballet flat or sleek Mary Jane from her own label, or a Birkenstock clog. On her arm, she toted her brand’s enduringly covetable Margaux bag—quite the contrast. But Ashley is a dab hand at high-low dressing and off-beat pairings: whether that’s a coat and flip-flop combo or twinning with her actual twin. While the stealth wealth emblem, the Margaux bag, has reached the upper echelons of desirability and virality, it’s also a pretty practical accessory for when you’re scooting about the city on a mission like Olsen. Then the Nike sneakers, with subtle detailing and a chunky, comfortable sole, makes more sense. Sneakers can be a tough pick—especially when your overall aesthetic leans more light and feminine. This week, Bella Hadid leaned into the ’80s Jane Fonda dance class aesthetic, pairing a tank top and polka dot bodycon shorts with distressed Coach sneakers. The Row’s Owen runner has become its own street style favorite over the years, and it doesn’t look like we’re getting over the Adidas Samba OG anytime soon, beloved by everyone from Emily Ratajkowski to Kendall Jenner. Puma’s Speedcats are picking up on the track, with Dua Lipa fronting its campaign. And if you so happened to be at Copenhagen Fashion Week, you’ll have spotted Cecilie Bahnsen’s romantic ASICS collabs on all the cool girls’ feet. (Be quick, a new, floral-studded drop is coming from Bahnsen x ASICS.) Both Olsen twins, too, are pros at dressing for the relentless cold: layering trenches and button-ups, expert layers, and knits. Even if a Margaux is a far-off dream, God knows we need Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen’s state of dressing pointers right now.

"As Peggy Flanagan Runs for Senate, a Look Back At Her Intentional Style",https://www.vogue.com/article/peggy-flanagan-election-trail-fashion,"February 20, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Earlier this morning, Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota Peggy Flanagan formally announced that she will be running to represent the state in the U.S. Senate. “A Native American woman has never won a seat in the U.S. Senate before,” Flanagan wrote on her Instagram page. “I believe we can change that. Are you with me?” Flanagan is seeking to replace Senator Tina Smith, who announced earlier this month that she would not seek re-election in 2026, opening up a seat for Minnesota. A Democrat who has served as Minnesota’s Lieutenant Governor since 2018, Flanagan was heavily involved in last year's Harris-Walz campaign. Throughout the race, her intentional fashion choices were impossible to miss. At the 2024 DNC, Flanagan wore a black and white Jamie Okuma Parfleche blazer and skirt, and a pair of Copper Canoe Woman statement earrings. Flanagan has chosen to spotlight contemporary Indigenous designers on the national stage (Flanagan is a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe). “I really want those earrings,” one viewer noted, while another simply exclaimed, “She is fabulous!” Wearing Jamie Okuma In the months that followed, as the presidential election race continued to accelerate, Flanagan only continued this intentional approach to dressing for the campaign trail. Whether speaking at rallies or canvassing for citizens to get out and vote, Flanagan has been using what she wears for a much deeper purpose—to draw attention to some of the nation’s finest Indigenous designers, and on a larger level, to draw awareness to the Indigenous community as a whole. (Especially in certain swing states, such as Arizona, where the Indigenous vote was crucial.) Wearing a traditional ribbon skirt It’s no secret that what politicians wear in the public domain is always strategic. Whereas Kamala Harris and Dr. Jill Biden have both embraced patriotic style—keeping to classic shades of red, white, and blue to demonstrate their love for their country—Flanagan has chosen colorful garments, including traditional ribbon skirts, as well as statement earrings (her signature piece) made of dentalium shells, beads, or turquoise; She has taken a distinctive approach that champions the unique beauty and craftwork found within her own Native community. The celebratory and upbeat feel of her ensembles is also fitting given that, if Flanagan is elected to the Senate, she would become the first Native American woman to win a seat; What she has worn, then, has nodded to this potentially historic moment. Flanagan's themed earrings Flanagan isn’t the only politician to take such a thoughtful approach to fashion, either. Throughout their times in office, Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland and Kansas Representative Sharice Davids have done so as well. For Haaland’s swearing-in ceremony back in 2021, she donned a vibrant traditional ribbon dress from Reecreations, moccasins, and dragonfly earrings made by the Laguna Pueblo metalsmith Pat Pruitt. For Flanagan, however, her joyful approach to style reflects how she is feeling in this very moment. “As the first Native American and woman of color elected statewide in Minnesota,” she wrote on Instagram, “I am overwhelmed with gratitude and hope.” This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

Bella Hadid Is Keeping the ’80s Alive,https://www.vogue.com/article/bella-hadid-is-keeping-the-80s-alive,"February 20, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Fashion may be obsessed with all things naughties at the moment, but Bella Hadid is all in on the 1980s. Yesterday in Los Angeles, the model left a photoshoot looking the picture of a jazzercise aficionado. She wore a sheer white tank top over a white bra and knee-length white shorts with black polka dots. The bodycon bottoms, from Miaou, were even affixed with a precious black bow. Rounding out her look was a pair of tall white socks scrunched around her calves and a pair of distressed Coach sneakers. Hadid opted for black accessories to complement the black micro polka dots in her shorts, trotting out her beloved Saint Laurent Y Bag and a pair of black sunglasses. While the look was plenty modern, we could easily imagine her starring in a series of exercise VHS tapes à la Jane Fonda, or appearing as a background actor in a remake of 1985’s Perfect. We feel confident that Bella Hadid could singlehandedly kickstart a jazzercise craze—or, at the very least, an ’80s-fashion moment.

Hailey Bieber Heralds the Return of This Divisive Shoe Trend,https://www.vogue.com/article/hailey-bieber-divisive-shoe-trend-peep-toe-heel,"February 20, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Hailey Bieber has returned to the West Coast after a mammoth stint away from home, packing away her enviable coat collection and sharp suiting that led her Aspen and New York wardrobes. For this Los Angeles homecoming and her latest Rhode pop-up, Bieber relied on some of her sartorial calling cards—adding a divisive vintage shoe trend. Bieber wore a fresh off the runway dress from the Ferragamo spring 2025 collection: an espresso brown leather mini-dress with sculptural details and a curved skirt, which she paired with a matching brown, croc leather pouch. On her feet, she wore strappy, laced sandals with an expansive peep-toe. The ’50s-era summer shoe is so back. The beauty founder stepped out party-ready at the launch of her latest product, the limited edition Sugar Cookie Peptide Lip Treatment. She posed with fans and friends at the pop-up, popping a sheer, chocolate brown tighted leg to show off the toe-exposing pumps. It was a chic way to wear the nostalgic—and much maligned—shoe silhouette. Following the event, Bieber was joined by her husband Justin—in his usual style of fits, comprising of baggy jeans, an even roomier leather jacket, and cap—and the pair were spotted heading for dinner at Funke with friends in Beverly Hills. Hailey added a faux fur coat. More ladylike shoe trends continue to emerge. Recent BAFTA winner Mikey Madison is a fan of Ferragamo’s patent t-bar sandal. The T-bar heel harks back to the ’40s and ’50s, a polite shoe silhouette worn often by Audrey Hepburn and repped also by everyone from Zoe Saldaña to Ariana Grande, in Jimmy Choo and Khaite respectively. The peep-toe’s comeback has been quiet yet assured, with some more modern updates: by way of Tory Burch’s sculpted peep-toe pumps with a crescent heel, Magda Butrym’s floral detail heels with a pearl just kissing the exposed toe, textured Alaïa slip-ons, and Dries Van Noten’s treble toe enveloping, piggie-baring mules. And with it still not being warm enough yet for bare legs and feet, a peep-toe paired with a sheer tight offers another teasing, sensual feeling layer a la Hailey Bieber.

27 of Rihanna’s Boldest Style Moments Throughout the Years,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/rihanna-style-statement-looks,"February 20, 2025",By Alice Cary,"As far as fashion is concerned, Rihanna has always been ahead of the curve—able to dabble in trends in a genuinely fearless manner. Risk-taking is central to her style influence, and what better time to revisit her epic wardrobe than today, on her 37th birthday? Off-duty, Rihanna is a true fashion girl. By day, she's in tracksuit-stiletto combos, gargantuan puffer jackets, and killer thigh-high boots. By night, she’s often wearing similarly casual gear, with the added touch of some vintage jewelry (or lots of diamonds) and a designer coat. Uniting her day-to-night dressing? A sense of fun and excitement: Don’t ever expect the star to wear discrete everyday basics. Rih’s red carpet looks command attention, too, though. In the noughties, she rocked low-rise trousers, crop tops, and plentiful diamanté. In 2015, she made headlines with a sunshine-yellow Guo Pei gown at the Met Gala, and her 2017 Comme des Garçons dress and 2018 John Galliano headpiece also broke the internet. More recently, she attended the Fashion Awards in London—with A$AP Rocky by her side—sporting a a Christian Lacroix fall 2002 couture mini dress with the matching oversized fuzzy hat, naturally. In honor of her birthday, revisit Rihanna’s most head-turning looks, below. Rih was one of the first out the gate in Saint Laurent’s fuzzy heart coat back in 2016, shown at the maison’s fall 2016 showcase. Many stars have braved the naked dress—Rihanna included. She commanded attention in a sparkling Swarovski crystal-encrusted look by Adam Selman at the CFDA Awards in 2014. Comme des Garçons was behind the eccentric look that she wore to the Met Gala in 2017. The vibrant gown that she wore to the Met Gala in 2015 will go down in history as one of the best looks the event has ever witnessed. Rihanna attended her Diamond Ball—a bash that she throws every year—wearing Alexis Mabille couture and Chopard jewels in 2018. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Saoirse Ronan Has Undergone a Style Shift for the Ages,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/saoirse-ronan-awards-season-style-2024,"February 19, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Earlier this year, Saoirse Ronan returned to the screen with a doubleheader: Steve McQueen’s World War II film Blitz, and her passion project, The Outrun, a drama about a woman just out of rehab. For her reentry into the public eye, Ronan tapped stylist Danielle Goldberg to help her meet the moment. Lo, Ronan’s rejuvenated sense of style has already set the internet ablaze, like when she was spotted wearing a vibrant teal JW Anderson dress—and fresh off the runway, no less. But, much like her prolific acting career, she’s no one-hit wonder. She’s turned heads in refined, yet unconventional looks, like her power-clashing moment in archival Phoebe Philo-era Celine from 2013 and the eggshell Khaite dress worn over trousers for a conversation with her Ladybird and Little Women costar Timothée Chalamet at BFI Southbank. But fashion fiends have been particularly thrilled with Goldberg styling the Oscar nominee in younger labels like newly minted LVMH Prize winner Hodakova, New York darling Colleen Allen, and ultra-cool sunglasses brand Thistles. We got an early taste of what we can expect from Ronan’s red carpet style at the 2024 Gotham Awards in New York City where the actor shot straight to best-dressed territory in an ankle-length Schiaparelli couture dress embellished with 3D thorns and complete with a rosette emerging from the neckline of her bustier. But she’s also gone the more classic route, like at the British Independent Film Awards, where she wore a sparkly dark blue caped dress—a custom Erdem. A regular collaborator with Nicolas Ghesquière, she turned to Louis Vuitton for the 2024 Emmys, where she wore a navy blue two-piece with a sheer draped panel, and again for the Academy Museum Gala where she opted for a black column dress with a sculptural off-the-shoulder top. The pair also kicked off the season on a high at the Governors Awards, where Ronan wore a light aqua Louis Vuitton column dress with a tactile bodice. Ghesquière also dressed the actor for the back-to-back IFTA and BAFTA Awards. For the former, Ronan wore a billowing strapless dress in that same beguiling blue as her JW Anderson mini; and at the BAFTAs, she wore a more subdued seafoam green scoop-neck with a matching stole. Follow along here as we celebrate Saoirse Ronan’s style throughout the 2024-2025 awards season.

Need Office Style Inspiration? Do Yourself a Favor and Watch Clockwatchers,https://www.vogue.com/article/clockwatchers-office-style-inspiration,"February 18, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"For those of us navigating the corporate world, getting dressed in a smart and professional look every day for work can be—well—a challenge. An endless calendar of deadlines and meetings means that you need a rotating wardrobe of smart shirts and sleek blazers to go with them. It can also be hard to have fun and add flavor into your work style, especially if you’re in a more traditional office setting. Investment banking in cool ripped jeans and a mesh JPG top? Unlikely. However. . . have you watched the underrated 1997 dark comedy Clockwatchers recently? If not, do it for the style inspiration alone: A recent re-watch of the workplace comedy has unearthed a goldmine of corporate style ideas worth taking notes on. If you have yet to see this often-overlooked film, let’s get the plot out of the way. Directed by Jill Sprecher and costume designed by Edi Giguere, the movie follows a group of Global Credit temporary employees as they navigate their unfulfilling day-to-day duties in the office. The real star of the show, though, is not the satiric script or the campy performances, but rather how each character brings their own unique approach to dressing for the corporate ladder. There’s Iris (Toni Collette), the new girl with a prim-and-proper sensibility, thanks to her buttoned-up cardigans and skirts; Margaret (Parker Posey), the edgy and jaded temp who stomps around in her cool chunky sweaters and grungy combat boots; Paula (Lisa Kudrow), an aspiring actor whose silky blouses and mini skirts lean into office siren territory; And Jane (Alanna Ubach), who dresses more ladylike in her classic shift dresses and statement jewelry. Talk about a star-studded cast—and their chic ensembles are just as noteworthy. Throughout the film, the four office friends slowly begin to descend into madness—the humdrum environment and corporate watchdogs causing them to grow more paranoid and unhappy by the day. But even as their polished facades come undone in the workplace, and their office goes dystopian and Orwellian real quick, their impeccable style persists. We first meet Paula, for instance, at the copy machine in a chic Gucci statement belt. Even near the end of the film, despite all of the grim happenings around them, her love for a good silky top and pristine blowout continues to steal all the scenes. The four characters each show how to bring personality to office looks. Margaret, for one, pairs a burgundy corduroy skirt suit with tights and chunky boots one day, and a teal V-neck sweater with a punky plaid skirt another; the perfect balances of dressy and cool. Paul and Jane each take turns wearing bold, bright-colored summer dresses that are a statement, yet still suitable for the boardroom. Watching the movie again has totally inspired me to rethink my approach to office dressing. The next time you’re doubting if your cool, trendy outfit is work-ready, just channel the Clockwatchers girls and remember: You can embrace fashion and individuality without being sent to Human Resources.

The print—whether horizontal or vertical, colorful or subdued—easily complements trending hues and patterns. For spring and summer, they tend to become the hero of the season, but this year another pattern is vying for your attention. Polka dots! Polka dot-printed clothing is about as classic as it gets, but we’ve seen a resurgence of the timeless pattern stamped onto new season silhouettes. It popped up during the spring/summer 2025 shows, making waves at Jacquemus and Acne Studios, and proved its staying power by re-emerging yet again on the fall/winter 2025 runways. Think of Altuzarra’s fall 2025 ready-to-wear collection, where dotted billowy coats, halterneck dresses, and knitwear were given a cool, laid-back kind of femininity. Brandon Maxwell showcased an artistic interpretation of the print with a brushed, drawn polka-dotted scarf coat. When it comes to styling your own polka-dot looks, you can never go wrong with traditional white and black. Jacquemus spring/summer 2025 For fresh color combinations, look to warm-weather-ready finds from Posse’s red-and-pink dotted sundress to Bode’s chocolate brown print. If you fancy the feminine—a flouncy tie-neck blouse and pleated skirt are ideal for the office, and a post-work date. If you’d prefer to go the casual route, wear a dotted button-up shirt with wide-leg linen trousers, then add a minimal sandal.

Keke Palmer Shakes Up a Classic White Shirtdress,https://www.vogue.com/article/keke-palmer-shakes-up-a-classic-white-shirtdress,"February 18, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Fashion can be a very serious business, but Keke Palmer—the bona fide comedian she is—knows that, sometimes, an outfit just needs a healthy dose of humor. Last night, at the 7th Annual American Black Film Festival Honors in Los Angeles, the actor brought some levity to a time-honored wardrobe staple: the white shirtdress. Styled by Zoe Costello, Palmer wore an off-the-shoulder Balmain number from Olivier Rousteing’s resort 2025 collection. Sexier than a de rigueur shirtdress, it featured a thigh-high slit and a cinched waist. Best of all, the trompe l’oeil number was complete with a stiff white collar—and a tag—over her décolletage, as if she was holding the dress in front of her. Palmer took the outfit in a different direction than the Balmain collection’s lookbook. She wore a pair of black pointy-toe pumps and added a gold bee brooch to the dress’s vestigial collar. Keke Palmer at the 7th Annual American Black Film Festival Honors. Balmain resort 2025. The actor has been all about bold fashion lately. On her recent press tour for her film One of Them Days, she broke out some serious vintage looks, including a cerulean John Galliano Dior dress from 2007, and a burnt orange Dolce & Gabbana from the same year. And that’s nothing to say of her contemporary looks. With some surreal Schiaparelli under her belt, it’s no wonder Keke Palmer embraced this funky Balmain shirtdress.

How To Get Rid Of Clothes Moths And Protect Your Wardrobe,https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-get-rid-of-clothes-moths,"February 18, 2025",By Ellie Pithers,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Moth-proofing your wardrobe is essential, if you don’t want the insects feeding on your most expensive cashmere knits and silk dresses. Clothes moths kill your investment pieces, and completely negates that big closet clean-out you did. While moth season tends to run from April to May, and then again from August to September, it’s become an issue throughout the U.S., thanks to rising temperatures. Not sure where to begin? Below, see Vogue’s top tips for preventing a moth infestation in your wardrobe—and how to tackle one if it’s already too late. Moths tend to be attracted to natural fibers like cashmere, silk, lambswool, shearling, and cotton because they feed on the protein keratin, the building block of these materials. Given that keratin also helps form human hair, skin, and nails, it’s crucial that you ensure your clothes are clean before you stow them away in your wardrobe. If you see a moth flying around your home, don’t fear. It’s not necessarily a clothes moth. The two main types that feed on your clothes in the United States—the webbing clothes moth (Tineola bisselliella) and the casemaking clothes moth (Tinea pellionella)—are small and difficult to see. The webbing clothes moth is identifiable from its golden color and around half an inch in length, while the casemaking clothes moth is pale, silvery gray-brown with dark spots, and fringed, hairy wings. Most people realize clothes moths have invaded their wardrobes when they see small holes in their knitwear or silk dresses. One option is to keep Pheromone super sticky glue traps, which attract the male moths, therefore removing them from the reproduction cycle, in your wardrobe or around your home. They also act as an indicator as to whether you have moths, or you can also use a moth box to monitor for a possible infestation. Moths eggs are tiny—usually between 0.5 to 1.5 millimeters in size—making them extremely difficult to see, but you might spot the webbing that larvae leave behind on your clothes. The life cycle of a moth is 65 to 90 days, with female moths laying up to 300 eggs each. This means your small moth problem can very quickly escalate. It’s the larvae that feast on natural fibers, not the adult moths which don’t actually have the ability to eat. Eggs will hatch after anything between four days and three weeks—in summer this process is faster than in winter. Yes—however it requires real commitment and dedication (and sometimes professional help) to get on top of an infestation. Once you have managed to do so, the key is to keep following the below steps to safeguard your wardrobe against clothes moths and prevent further infestations from happening again and again. Moths can enter your home through cracks, windows, and on new items of clothing, so just because you have got on top of your problem doesn’t mean they won’t return. Moths like undisturbed corners that are dark and warm. Remove everything from your wardrobe, vacuum all the corners and drawers, and wipe all your surfaces with a detergent-soaked cloth to kill off larvae. Then wash all of your clothes (and curtains and upholstery, too). Dry cleaning kills moth eggs and larvae, and is an excellent option for bulky items like coats. Freeze anything you can fit on your freezer shelves; sub-zero temperatures kill larvae, although make sure you put clothes in plastic bags prior to freezing to avoid a condensation build-up. Keep them in there for at least 48 hours, or up to a week if you can. Heat also kills larvae and eggs, however, hot temperatures can damage cashmere. To ensure you’ve got rid of all the larvae and eggs, Total Wardrobe Care’s Julia Dee explains that you can start by “applying natural moth-killing products, such as chrysanthemum-based sprays.” This will prevent any more moths hatching, so you don’t go back to square one. A moth infestation can cause thousands of pounds worth of damage depending on the clothes you have in your wardrobe, and so bringing in the professionals to fumigate your house if the problem is significant is often worth the investment. Moths love to feast on human sweat, food particles, and stains. Do not put any clothes back in your newly cleaned wardrobe that are dirty—especially knitwear or natural fibers. As well as laundering your clothes, ensure that your wardrobe and drawers are also clean. “Regularly wipe down surfaces with soapy water and thoroughly vacuum cracks and crevices to remove any larvae or eggs,” Dee recommends. Moths hate light and movement, so this can also help disturb them. Always store winter knits, coats, and any other items you particularly value in zipped garment bags (like knitwear and cashmere bags), and line the bags with anti-moth paper strips. Line your drawers in anti-moth paper, and deploy cedarwood blocks. Vintage clothes should always be dry cleaned or put in the freezer before being introduced to your wardrobe, as they are often the source of infestations. Moths hate them, and they’ll keep the shoulders on your dresses and jackets neat, too. Always take your clothes out of the plastic hanging bags from the dry cleaner. The plastic attracts dust, and the dust attracts moths. Keep checking your clothes for moth holes, keep rooms well-ventilated as temperatures start to rise, and keep a natural oil diffuser in your wardrobe at all times—it smells great and wards off moths. Moth cassettes are also a good precautionary measure, and you can keep them hanging on your rail at all times. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Rising Star David Jonsson Is More Than Ready For His Rat Pack Moment,https://www.vogue.com/article/david-jonsson-baftas-2025-rising-fashion-star,"February 17, 2025",By Kerry McDermott,"“I’m an introvert by nature,” David Jonsson tells Vogue, days before attending the 2025 BAFTAs, where he was in the running for the Rising Star prize (spoiler alert: he won!). While walking the red carpet doesn’t necessarily come naturally to the Rye Lane star, “it’s made 10 times easier when you look good,” he says with a smile. To that end, the 31-year-old has chosen a custom Gucci tux with a Swarovski embroidered vest and a satin bow tie for the biggest night in British film—which earned him a major milestone in his own career (previous Rising Star winners include Tom Hardy, John Boyega, Daniel Kaluuya and Tom Holland). “I remember the kids growing up in my area in east London, you know, people would go to desperate lengths to wear Gucci. It really feels special.” He’s accessorized with the help of “another dream brand,” Cartier, which supplied David’s rare Cloche de Cartier timepiece. “It’s in the shape of a D, funnily enough,” he says, listing watches as one of his guilty pleasures, along with cars and motorcycles. (“I sound like such a boy.”) “For me, part of fashion is functionality,” says Jonsson, who is currently preparing to play Sammy Davis Jr to Sydney Sweeney’s Kim Novak in Colman Domingo’s directorial debut, Scandalous. “You can use it to your favor: to exude confidence or exude sexiness or exude class, or whatever. If I don’t feel confident in something, I’d rather go nude!” Growing up, he says, that meant throwing on a graphic tee, or “whatever you feel good in,” but the actor increasingly finds himself drawn to tailoring. “I’ve been looking a lot at Sammy Davis Jr and the Rat Pack. Those men…They knew how to dress up.” Jonsson no doubt has plenty of awards ceremonies in his future, and he’s learning to embrace the process of getting ready for a red carpet. “I learn a lot from actors that I adore, and I remember Cillian Murphy saying, you’d be an [idiot] not to enjoy these moments,” he says. “I love the rituals of getting ready… a nice shower, and I’m a big fan of scents as well. Those are the moments I like taking some time over. When you get to wear stuff like what I’m wearing to the BAFTAs, you should take your time, you know?

Dakota Johnson Puts Her Own Twist on the Safety Pin Dress With a Sexy Slit,https://www.vogue.com/article/dakota-johnson-dress-slit-snl50,"February 17, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"It’s been a while since we’ve had a show-stopping dress slit. Purveyors of the classic and sexy red carpet look range from Angelina Jolie to Miley Cyrus—another lover of the leggy affair? Dakota Johnson. And this time, the actor went from thigh-high to hip-kissing. Johnson stepped out on the red carpet for Saturday Night Live’s 50th anniversary special at 30 Rockerfeller Center on Sunday evening (February 16)—a starry event celebrating the pop culture behemoth, with attendees including Vogue cover star Sabrina Carpenter, Kim Kardashian, Miley Cyrus, Emma Stone, and Bad Bunny. The Madame Web actor wore a black, one-sleeved Gucci gown fastened with delicate gold hardware and a bodysuit underneath, allowing the brave slit to travel up to her hips. She also wore black open-toed stilettos and minimal jewelry, with a sweep of eyebrow-skimming bangs and her brunette hair long and straight. The delicate gold chains holding Johnson’s Gucci dress together recalled another sensual and daring red carpet look: the safety pin dress, which through the years, has been worn by Anne Hathaway, Miley Cyrus, Kristen Stewart, and of course the vivacious original, Elizabeth Hurley in Versace. Johnson’s own interpretation is stoically sensual. It was a stylish weekend of events celebrating Saturday Night Live’ 50th year, that ran the gamut of true Hollywood glam and campy looks. Emma Stone filled her custom Louis Vuitton gown pockets with popcorn and toted a cinema snack box in lieu of a bag, while Miley Cyrus donned two Roberto Cavalli looks—one recent runway, one archival—for a gothic showgirl performance. For her own stage-time to do the ever-iconic “D*ck in a Box” song, Lady Gaga wore a black velvet gown with a zany-patterned gift box attached to her waist. Glamor, intrigue, sex—a stellar sartorial tribute to SNL. Johnson is no stranger to skin-forward gowns, and it’s usually Gucci that’s her go-to: sheer, silvered, shimmering. But what Dakota Johnson surely proves here is that sometimes, your legs are your best accessory. Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

Emma Stone Takes the ‘Popcorn Actress’ Label Literally,https://www.vogue.com/article/emma-stone-popcorn-dress-snl-50,"February 17, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"One of those best things about going out to see a show? The theater snacks. Maybe a box of nachos or a little cup of ice-cream to see you through the evening—but Emma Stone is all about the popcorn. And she made sure she had enough to hand at SNL50: The Anniversary Special in New York City, by wearing her own cinema snacks on her hips. The actor stepped onto the red carpet with partner and former SNL writer Dave McCary sporting a custom Louis Vuitton, cinema seat red, halterneck dress. The dress had two pockets that were heaping with popcorn. The rest of Stone’s look was simple: Louis Vuitton red heels, gold star-shaped earrings, and in lieu of a bag, a candy-striped popcorn box filled with more popcorn that she of course helped herself to. Stone wore her hair in her latest pixie cut. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. It was also a special sort of date night for Stone and McCary ,who first met in 2016, when Stone, who hosted SNL in December that same year, starred in a sketch directed by McCary, “Wells for Boys.” Stone is also one of only a few five-time SNL hosts (and remains the youngest to have ever done so) including Steve Martin and Tom Hanks. It’s also not the first time popcorn has been part of the 2025 entertainment industry chatter. Rewind, to Demi Moore’s speech at the 2025 Golden Globes ,when she won best actress for The Substance. It marked the first major industry award in the 62-year-old actor’s 45-year career, and in her moving acceptance speech, she acknowledged the stereotypes she has faced for having starred in films primed for entertainment value and box-office earnings over critical reception or contributions to cinema discourse—defying the ‘popcorn actress’ label. And as the weekend of SNL celebrations continued and we reflected on the mammoth show’s impact on pop culture, the moniker feels even more foolish. Stone’s snackable style was by longtime stylist Petra Flannery, whose other client Zoe Saldaña took home best supporting actress for Emilia Perez at the BAFTAs on the same evening. Less campy than Stone but still big on the drama, Zoe Saldaña wore a pleated collar Yves Saint Laurent gown. We could maybe just about get away with likening Stone’s popcorn-filled pockets to the structured hips and peplum silhouetted gowns that are more in keeping with her usual red carpet style: like her eggshell colored 2024 Oscars gown, or her red shelf-hipped 2025 Golden Globes dress—both also by Louis Vuitton. Popcorn pockets or whimsy peplums, Stone tends to lean into classic Hollywood glamor and elegant gowns. Her last red carpet surprise was all about her newly done pixie cut—which she’s likely cut for Bugonia, her latest film with Yorgos Lanthimos and which is set to debut in 2025. Stone’s SNL50 dress went down well with fellow attendees—Seth Rogan even got a couple of handfuls. Feeling peckish? Emma Stone’s got you. But one question that remains: was it sweet or salted, buttered or toffee? More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Blake Lively Brings Her Love of Florals to SNL’s 50th Anniversary Special,https://www.vogue.com/article/blake-lively-saturday-night-live-florals-red-carpet,"February 16, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Tonight, the Saturday Night Live 50th Anniversary Special airs on NBC—celebrating five decades of the hit sketch comedy show, with a slew of celebrity guest cameos. The red carpet premiere in New York City was extremely star studded: Kim Kardashian, Bad Bunny, Meryl Streep, Anya Taylor-Joy, and more all hit the step and repeat. One high-profile duo in the mix? Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, who attended the occasion in their finest formal attire. Lively opted for her signature red carpet look for the night: a glitzy floral-covered dress. (Fans of the star will recall she wore floral designs nonstop throughout her It Ends With Us press tour, as a nod to her character in the film, who is a florist.) Lively’s latest SNL look consisted of a silver Tamara Ralph sequin-covered gown, complete with floral embellishments throughout. For a more monochromatic finish, she accessorized with diamonds and strappy metallic hells. Reynolds, meanwhile, wore a classic black tuxedo, white dress shirt, and a bowtie. Tonight marked one of Lively’s first major public appearances since reports of a legal battle between her and her It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni emerged—a dispute which remains ongoing.

Inside the Stylish Weekend Celebrating Saturday Night Live’s 50th Anniversary,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/saturday-night-live-50th-anniversary-red-carpet,"February 16, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Saturday Night Live is marking a major milestone: This weekend, the iconic sketch comedy show from creator Lorne Michaels is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a slew of events in New York City. The festivities kicked off on Friday evening, with the SNL50: The Homecoming Concert at Radio City Music Hall. Naturally, the red carpet was a star-studded affair. Given SNL has welcomed hundreds of A-list hosts and musical guests over the years (it’s hard to think of a big star who hasn’t made a cameo on the show), it was only fitting that many celebrities joined the fun. Among those who walked the step and repeat on Friday were Miley Cyrus, Chris Pine, Christine Baranski—each one of them bringing some good, old-fashioned glitz and glamour to the party. Inside the historic venue, Lady Gaga performed “Shallow” with Andy Samberg, and did a funny bit to botch the song, before performing “Dick in a Box”—their 2009 SNL parody banger. Gaga, in a velvet black dress, stood with a zany giftbox taped to her waist—three guesses as to what they’re insinuating is inside. Miley Cyrus took to the stage in her gothic showgirl glory to perform “Flowers”, do a cover of Queen’s “Crazy Little Thing Called Love” with Brittany Howard, and shout that she loves Paul Rudd. Cher also performed “If I Could Turn Back Time,” well as Bad Bunny, Post Malone, The Backstreet Boys, The B-52’s, and Will Ferrell and Ana Gasteyer (who did their own hilarious versions of songs like Doechii’s “Denial is a River.” The celebrations continued on Sunday night, with the official SNL50: The Anniversary Special airing on NBC. Another step and repeat premiere was held for the release—and even more celebrities came out for the viewing party. Below, see all of the stars at SNL’s 50th-anniversary kickoff and how things went down inside. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

The Best Dressed Stars From the 2025 BAFTAs,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/best-dressed-stars-2025-baftas-red-carpet,"February 16, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"This evening in London, the 2025 BAFTAs marked the latest celebration of some of the last year’s best film and television projects—among them Wicked, Emilia Pérez, Anora, and Conclave. As such, the red carpet saw a bevy of A-list stars turn out for the affair (many of whom are also nominated for Academy Awards in March). The best dressed stars of the night? Those who leaned into New Hollywood glamour (yes, you read that right), choosing sculptural silhouettes and modernized finishes that felt fresh. Take Wicked star Cynthia Erivo, who went ethereal in her white macramé cotton lace bustier gown (with a breastplate that defied gravity—get it?). In McQueen, Demi Moore also turned heads in a dazzling gown that was reminiscent of stained glass, while Emilia Pérez star Selena Gomez chose a long, sleeveless gown by Schiaparelli Couture embroidered with silver sequins, crystals, rhinestones, and tassels—talk about disco ball dressing at its finest. As for some of the best dressed gents of the night? Colman Domingo reworked traditional suiting in a printed shirt and leather coat by Versace. Timothée Chalamet went sleek in all black Bottega Veneta—a refreshing switch-up from the bolder, more Y2K-leaning looks he has been wearing while promoting A Complete Unknown. (And isn’t that the making of a true fashion star—keeping us on our toes?) Below, see the best dressed stars from the 2025 BAFTAs. Is this your favorite look? Is this your favorite look?

Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner Do Matching Couple Style at the BAFTAs,https://www.vogue.com/article/timothee-chalamet-kylie-jenner-couple-style-baftas-2025,"February 16, 2025",By Olivia Allen,"With the 2025 BAFTAs in full swing, Timothée Chalamet has once again got us talking. Fresh off the A Complete Unknown press tour–zipping around on a Lime bike in Martine Rose and fully leaning into his Bob Dylan era—his latest look continues the streak. Over the weekend, he made waves at the Berlin Film Festival, out in Kendrick-inspired bootcut jeans and accompanying Kylie Jenner in a pink Chrome Hearts tracksuit—a stark contrast against his girlfriend’s glittering gown. For tonight’s red carpet, though, Timmy went for something a bit more classic. The best-actor nominee wore a double-breasted, all-black ensemble by Bottega Veneta—proving that sometimes simplicity really is best. It was a departure from his laidback athleisure looks this week, but felt like exactly the right choice for his moment in the limelight. While Jenner skipped the step and repeat (as she did at the Golden Globes and in Berlin), the beauty mogul was spotted inside the ceremony wearing a black embellished slip dress—perfectly matching Timothée’s sleek red carpet look.

Cynthia Erivo’s Louis Vuitton Breastplate Defies Gravity at the 2025 BAFTAs,https://www.vogue.com/article/cynthia-erivo-louis-vuitton-dress-baftas-2025,"February 16, 2025",By Olivia Allen,"Cynthia Erivo knows how to make an entrance, and she did just that at the 2025 BAFTAs tonight. In a white lace-embroidered Louis Vuitton gown, the Wicked star delivered a sculptural look that solidified her reputation for bold, red-carpet winning fashion. With its sharp architectural design, the dress was a statement that held space (get it?) from head to toe. While Erivo delivered a series of Elphaba-green looks during the Wicked press tour, the British actor has shifted towards a more monochrome colour palette during awards season—from the black-and-white floral gown she wore at the Golden Globes (also by Louis Vuitton) to the black sequined Armani Privè gown she wore at the Critics Choice Awards. Nominated for Best Actress at this year’s BAFTAs, Erivo’s transition from Broadway to film has been the stuff of legends—with three Oscars nominations under her belt, she’s solidified her place among Hollywood’s elite. As she gears up to co-host Vogue’s Fashion & Film party, it’s clear that Erivo is an unstoppable force both on screen and off. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Ayo Edebiri Wore New York Fashion Week’s Rising Star for SNL 50,https://www.vogue.com/article/ayo-edebiri-snl-colleen-allen-new-york-fashion-week-rising-star,"February 18, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"It’s no secret that Ayo Edebiri quickly ascended to one of Hollywood’s best dressers in almost no time. While the actor has courted brands from Loewe to Prada, she’s always down to push the envelope with more avant-garde labels—with a helping hand from her stylist, Danielle Goldberg. Now, she’s the first to wear a brand-new piece from one of New York Fashion Week’s fast-rising stars, Colleen Allen. Edebiri was among the dozens of stars who participated in SNL’s 50th anniversary special over the weekend. The actor, who hosted the show in February 20204 returned to the hallowed halls of 30 Rock, joining Robert DeNiro, Drew Barrymore, Jimmy Fallon, and Rachel Dratch in a reprisal of “Debbie Downer.” Ayo Edebiri Colleen Allen fall 2025, look 2. The sketch was a black-tie affair, and Edebiri tapped Allen for the occasion, choosing a piece from the designer’s fall 2025 collection: a floor-length black velvet dress featuring a plunging, smocked neckline, which Edebiri styled with a black Sophie Buhai choker with a silver pendant. The dress debuted at NYFW just last week in an appointment-only presentation that my colleague José Criales-Unzueta described as “New York’s hottest club.” While Ayo Edebiri may not have been among the fashion editors who oohed and ahhed over Allen’s sumptuous velvets and rich color palette in person, she reminded us at SNL that she’s always got her finger on the pulse.

How To Get Rid Of Clothes Moths And Protect Your Wardrobe,https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-get-rid-of-clothes-moths,"February 18, 2025",By Ellie Pithers,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Moth-proofing your wardrobe is essential, if you don’t want the insects feeding on your most expensive cashmere knits and silk dresses. Clothes moths kill your investment pieces, and completely negates that big closet clean-out you did. While moth season tends to run from April to May, and then again from August to September, it’s become an issue throughout the U.S., thanks to rising temperatures. Not sure where to begin? Below, see Vogue’s top tips for preventing a moth infestation in your wardrobe—and how to tackle one if it’s already too late. Moths tend to be attracted to natural fibers like cashmere, silk, lambswool, shearling, and cotton because they feed on the protein keratin, the building block of these materials. Given that keratin also helps form human hair, skin, and nails, it’s crucial that you ensure your clothes are clean before you stow them away in your wardrobe. If you see a moth flying around your home, don’t fear. It’s not necessarily a clothes moth. The two main types that feed on your clothes in the United States—the webbing clothes moth (Tineola bisselliella) and the casemaking clothes moth (Tinea pellionella)—are small and difficult to see. The webbing clothes moth is identifiable from its golden color and around half an inch in length, while the casemaking clothes moth is pale, silvery gray-brown with dark spots, and fringed, hairy wings. Most people realize clothes moths have invaded their wardrobes when they see small holes in their knitwear or silk dresses. One option is to keep Pheromone super sticky glue traps, which attract the male moths, therefore removing them from the reproduction cycle, in your wardrobe or around your home. They also act as an indicator as to whether you have moths, or you can also use a moth box to monitor for a possible infestation. Moths eggs are tiny—usually between 0.5 to 1.5 millimeters in size—making them extremely difficult to see, but you might spot the webbing that larvae leave behind on your clothes. The life cycle of a moth is 65 to 90 days, with female moths laying up to 300 eggs each. This means your small moth problem can very quickly escalate. It’s the larvae that feast on natural fibers, not the adult moths which don’t actually have the ability to eat. Eggs will hatch after anything between four days and three weeks—in summer this process is faster than in winter. Yes—however it requires real commitment and dedication (and sometimes professional help) to get on top of an infestation. Once you have managed to do so, the key is to keep following the below steps to safeguard your wardrobe against clothes moths and prevent further infestations from happening again and again. Moths can enter your home through cracks, windows, and on new items of clothing, so just because you have got on top of your problem doesn’t mean they won’t return. Moths like undisturbed corners that are dark and warm. Remove everything from your wardrobe, vacuum all the corners and drawers, and wipe all your surfaces with a detergent-soaked cloth to kill off larvae. Then wash all of your clothes (and curtains and upholstery, too). Dry cleaning kills moth eggs and larvae, and is an excellent option for bulky items like coats. Freeze anything you can fit on your freezer shelves; sub-zero temperatures kill larvae, although make sure you put clothes in plastic bags prior to freezing to avoid a condensation build-up. Keep them in there for at least 48 hours, or up to a week if you can. Heat also kills larvae and eggs, however, hot temperatures can damage cashmere. To ensure you’ve got rid of all the larvae and eggs, Total Wardrobe Care’s Julia Dee explains that you can start by “applying natural moth-killing products, such as chrysanthemum-based sprays.” This will prevent any more moths hatching, so you don’t go back to square one. A moth infestation can cause thousands of pounds worth of damage depending on the clothes you have in your wardrobe, and so bringing in the professionals to fumigate your house if the problem is significant is often worth the investment. Moths love to feast on human sweat, food particles, and stains. Do not put any clothes back in your newly cleaned wardrobe that are dirty—especially knitwear or natural fibers. As well as laundering your clothes, ensure that your wardrobe and drawers are also clean. “Regularly wipe down surfaces with soapy water and thoroughly vacuum cracks and crevices to remove any larvae or eggs,” Dee recommends. Moths hate light and movement, so this can also help disturb them. Always store winter knits, coats, and any other items you particularly value in zipped garment bags (like knitwear and cashmere bags), and line the bags with anti-moth paper strips. Line your drawers in anti-moth paper, and deploy cedarwood blocks. Vintage clothes should always be dry cleaned or put in the freezer before being introduced to your wardrobe, as they are often the source of infestations. Moths hate them, and they’ll keep the shoulders on your dresses and jackets neat, too. Always take your clothes out of the plastic hanging bags from the dry cleaner. The plastic attracts dust, and the dust attracts moths. Keep checking your clothes for moth holes, keep rooms well-ventilated as temperatures start to rise, and keep a natural oil diffuser in your wardrobe at all times—it smells great and wards off moths. Moth cassettes are also a good precautionary measure, and you can keep them hanging on your rail at all times. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

The White Lotus Season 3 Fashion Is All About Loud Luxury,https://www.vogue.com/article/the-white-lotus-season-3-fashion-is-all-about-loud-luxury,"February 17, 2025",By Fawnia Soo Hoo,"Set on the picturesque island of Koh Samui, the third season of The White Lotus delivers plenty of immersive vacation porn as well as enviably audacious designer wardrobes on a new slate of badly behaving guests. “We don’t do quiet luxury,” says returning costume designer Alex Bovaird, who received two out of her three Emmy nominations for the first two seasons of the Mike White series. As a fresh set of potential Blossom Circle members take in the stunning views from the private boat to the resort, Raleigh, North Carolina, matriarch Victoria Ratliff (Parker Posey), tightly clutching her Gucci 1947 bamboo top-handle bag, turns down her nose at fellow guests—and the entire Thailand experience. With a bright blue silk scarf by Swaine London primly tied over the shoulders of her preppy Banana Republic shirtdress, Victoria wishes she was in England—or anywhere in western Europe—with her three children and sketchy financier husband Timothy (Jason Isaacs). “My inspiration for [the Ratliffs] was as if they just stepped out of a Ralph Lauren catalog,” says Bovaird. But Victoria did pack a suitcase, presumably checked first-class, of “loud Lilly Pulitzer”–esque dresses and floaty cover-ups, perfect for sipping mint juleps by a members-only pool. Bovaird referenced how the society set in Oxford, Mississippi, dress and the lifestyle of “the caftan queen of Birmingham, Alabama,” Susan Dumas. “She and her country club friends love vintage caftans,” says Bovaird, who also designed a resort-ready White Lotus–inspired collaboration with H&M. The eldest Ratliff sibling, Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger), thirsty for his withholding father’s approval, immediately telegraphs douchebag bro in one of his many Southern Tide polo shirts, wraparound Roger Federer sunglasses, and Gucci loafers sans socks. “His shorts are Brooks Brothers, and they’re just not the cool length,” says Bovaird. Younger sister Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook), who’s seeking spirituality on the island, hints at the burgeoning disconnect from her family with her ’80s-referential Ralph Lauren white lace dress. “She is a little bit more of the pure voice who’s looking for something more meaningful than her very materialistic family,” says Bovaird, who referenced a teenage Brooke Shields for Piper’s demure embroidered and lace-trimmed dresses. “[She’s] a bit more earthy, really wholesome, and a little more covered up.” Off to the side, a trio of 40-something childhood best friends giggle and gossip at the start of their decadent, and potentially debauched, reunion trip. In their coordinating sundresses, bags, and blonde highlights, they could be a girl group: TV actor Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan) in Alemais and Valentino; Austin socialite Kate (Leslie Bibb) in Paul Smith and Delvaux; and New York City lawyer Laurie (Carrie Coon) in Zimmermann and Loewe—check, check, and check. “They’re supposed to look interchangeable, but Laurie is the one who’s maybe trying to keep up with the girls,” says Bovaird. For the first-night dinner, Laurie dons a vintage Sue Wong watercolor-print jumpsuit, and later cries into her Giambattista Valli chain-link bag. Meanwhile, Kate, in red ruffle-tiered Lanvin, and Jaclyn, in a gold dragon-embroidered ’70s black vintage dress, trade fake, backhanded compliments. Jaclyn also employs her holiday as an opportunity for designer spon-con. “We imagined that she got a box of resort pieces that Valentino sent over. Maybe Kate grabbed a suit out of Jaclyn’s box,” says Bovaird. “Because that’s true to life—brands want to support actors.” For their first trip to the pool, Kate wraps a black-and-white panther-print sarong from the 2023 Escape collection around the waist of a Valentino hot pink maillot. Jaclyn, who’s regularly recognized by guests, appropriately called dibs on the showier, logo-mania pieces, like an oversized shirt cover-up and a flashy silver-sequined minidress. But odd couple Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood) and older boyfriend Rick (Walton Goggins) don’t quite fit in with the designer label–stacked façade of their fellow guests. “You’re supposed to bump up against them and think, Who are these two grifters? Because they are a little bit less put-together,” says Bovaird. “They seem like a couple of rogues. You’re just supposed to wonder what their story is, and they’re supposed to have a crackling sexual chemistry.” A grizzled Rick broods and smolders in a steady rotation of slouchy, halfway unbuttoned Hawaiian shirts, giving off the aura of an American expat with a questionable livelihood but deep pockets. Free-spirited Mancunian Chelsea takes selfies in a cutout My Beachy Side minidress. “She has this louche, sexy, Brigitte Bardot [vibe],” says Bovaird. “She’s been traveling for several years. We imagined she got the crochet dress from a market, or she collected things from Goa. She’s supposed to have this very market-driven, eclectic wardrobe.” Chelsea effortlessly mixes vintage with market-bought sarongs and minidresses, but her colorful bikinis are mostly by Corsica-based Tara Matthews. Chelsea also pairs a parrot-print vintage-looking Loewe wrap skirt with a throwback Blondie T-shirt, and carries JW Anderson and Louis Vuitton bags. “She has lots of sunglasses that she ‘got down at the market,’ but are actually by Jacquemus,” says Bovaird. Jacquemus also custom-designed two full looks for model Chloe (Charlotte LeBon), who a lonely Chelsea meets at the resort bar. (Keep an eye on Chloe’s “LBH”—“losers back home”—boyfriend, Gary, played by Jon Gries, who can’t seem to resist the nearest White Lotus location.) “[Jacquemus] designed special pieces just for The White Lotus in Thailand and hand-delivered them to Koh Samui,” says Bovaird about Chloe’s black-and-white polka-dotted bodysuit and striped, sequined skirt outfit that Chelsea admires, and a pink one-piece and sheer sarong for a yacht party. The White Lotus Maui spa manager Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) threads all three seasons of the slow-burn series together, as she spends a month at the Koh Samui outpost for a work-share session. She enjoys hands-on massage sessions with her very fit Thai counterpart, Pornchai (Dom Hetrakul)—and a resort wardrobe filled with colorful, tropical-print dresses and caftans from brands like Anthropologie and Verandah. “Belinda is a little self-conscious that she’s there on her work trip,” says Bovaird, who also custom-made looks with vibrant Thai fabrics for the character. “When she’s out of her uniform, she wants to feel as good as the guests.” Speaking of, what was it like putting Lalisa Manoban, aka Lisa of Blackpink, in a uniform to play resort staffer Mook? “I think it was refreshing for her not to worry too much about the bits and baubles, and making sure everything was super-fashionable,” says Bovaird. With the help of a local Thai crew, and input from Manoban, Bovaird custom-designed Mook’s blouse-and-sarong uniform. But the staffer first greets the guests in a cute palm-tree-and-monkey-embroidered short-sleeve shirt-and-shorts set that’s by Tombolo. “This season, we definitely upped our game,” says Bovaird. “We definitely had the right shoe for the right swimsuits, cover-ups, hats, bags, and sunglasses. Whereas, in season one, we were like, ‘Here are your flip-flops.’” Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

Dakota Johnson Puts Her Own Twist on the Safety Pin Dress With a Sexy Slit,https://www.vogue.com/article/dakota-johnson-dress-slit-snl50,"February 17, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"It’s been a while since we’ve had a show-stopping dress slit. Purveyors of the classic and sexy red carpet look range from Angelina Jolie to Miley Cyrus—another lover of the leggy affair? Dakota Johnson. And this time, the actor went from thigh-high to hip-kissing. Johnson stepped out on the red carpet for Saturday Night Live’s 50th anniversary special at 30 Rockerfeller Center on Sunday evening (February 16)—a starry event celebrating the pop culture behemoth, with attendees including Vogue cover star Sabrina Carpenter, Kim Kardashian, Miley Cyrus, Emma Stone, and Bad Bunny. The Madame Web actor wore a black, one-sleeved Gucci gown fastened with delicate gold hardware and a bodysuit underneath, allowing the brave slit to travel up to her hips. She also wore black open-toed stilettos and minimal jewelry, with a sweep of eyebrow-skimming bangs and her brunette hair long and straight. The delicate gold chains holding Johnson’s Gucci dress together recalled another sensual and daring red carpet look: the safety pin dress, which through the years, has been worn by Anne Hathaway, Miley Cyrus, Kristen Stewart, and of course the vivacious original, Elizabeth Hurley in Versace. Johnson’s own interpretation is stoically sensual. It was a stylish weekend of events celebrating Saturday Night Live’ 50th year, that ran the gamut of true Hollywood glam and campy looks. Emma Stone filled her custom Louis Vuitton gown pockets with popcorn and toted a cinema snack box in lieu of a bag, while Miley Cyrus donned two Roberto Cavalli looks—one recent runway, one archival—for a gothic showgirl performance. For her own stage-time to do the ever-iconic “D*ck in a Box” song, Lady Gaga wore a black velvet gown with a zany-patterned gift box attached to her waist. Glamor, intrigue, sex—a stellar sartorial tribute to SNL. Johnson is no stranger to skin-forward gowns, and it’s usually Gucci that’s her go-to: sheer, silvered, shimmering. But what Dakota Johnson surely proves here is that sometimes, your legs are your best accessory. Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

Emma Stone Takes the ‘Popcorn Actress’ Label Literally,https://www.vogue.com/article/emma-stone-popcorn-dress-snl-50,"February 17, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"One of those best things about going out to see a show? The theater snacks. Maybe a box of nachos or a little cup of ice-cream to see you through the evening—but Emma Stone is all about the popcorn. And she made sure she had enough to hand at SNL50: The Anniversary Special in New York City, by wearing her own cinema snacks on her hips. The actor stepped onto the red carpet with partner and former SNL writer Dave McCary sporting a custom Louis Vuitton, cinema seat red, halterneck dress. The dress had two pockets that were heaping with popcorn. The rest of Stone’s look was simple: Louis Vuitton red heels, gold star-shaped earrings, and in lieu of a bag, a candy-striped popcorn box filled with more popcorn that she of course helped herself to. Stone wore her hair in her latest pixie cut. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. It was also a special sort of date night for Stone and McCary ,who first met in 2016, when Stone, who hosted SNL in December that same year, starred in a sketch directed by McCary, “Wells for Boys.” Stone is also one of only a few five-time SNL hosts (and remains the youngest to have ever done so) including Steve Martin and Tom Hanks. It’s also not the first time popcorn has been part of the 2025 entertainment industry chatter. Rewind, to Demi Moore’s speech at the 2025 Golden Globes ,when she won best actress for The Substance. It marked the first major industry award in the 62-year-old actor’s 45-year career, and in her moving acceptance speech, she acknowledged the stereotypes she has faced for having starred in films primed for entertainment value and box-office earnings over critical reception or contributions to cinema discourse—defying the ‘popcorn actress’ label. And as the weekend of SNL celebrations continued and we reflected on the mammoth show’s impact on pop culture, the moniker feels even more foolish. Stone’s snackable style was by longtime stylist Petra Flannery, whose other client Zoe Saldaña took home best supporting actress for Emilia Perez at the BAFTAs on the same evening. Less campy than Stone but still big on the drama, Zoe Saldaña wore a pleated collar Yves Saint Laurent gown. We could maybe just about get away with likening Stone’s popcorn-filled pockets to the structured hips and peplum silhouetted gowns that are more in keeping with her usual red carpet style: like her eggshell colored 2024 Oscars gown, or her red shelf-hipped 2025 Golden Globes dress—both also by Louis Vuitton. Popcorn pockets or whimsy peplums, Stone tends to lean into classic Hollywood glamor and elegant gowns. Her last red carpet surprise was all about her newly done pixie cut—which she’s likely cut for Bugonia, her latest film with Yorgos Lanthimos and which is set to debut in 2025. Stone’s SNL50 dress went down well with fellow attendees—Seth Rogan even got a couple of handfuls. Feeling peckish? Emma Stone’s got you. But one question that remains: was it sweet or salted, buttered or toffee? More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Blake Lively Brings Her Love of Florals to SNL’s 50th Anniversary Special,https://www.vogue.com/article/blake-lively-saturday-night-live-florals-red-carpet,"February 16, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Tonight, the Saturday Night Live 50th Anniversary Special airs on NBC—celebrating five decades of the hit sketch comedy show, with a slew of celebrity guest cameos. The red carpet premiere in New York City was extremely star studded: Kim Kardashian, Bad Bunny, Meryl Streep, Anya Taylor-Joy, and more all hit the step and repeat. One high-profile duo in the mix? Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, who attended the occasion in their finest formal attire. Lively opted for her signature red carpet look for the night: a glitzy floral-covered dress. (Fans of the star will recall she wore floral designs nonstop throughout her It Ends With Us press tour, as a nod to her character in the film, who is a florist.) Lively’s latest SNL look consisted of a silver Tamara Ralph sequin-covered gown, complete with floral embellishments throughout. For a more monochromatic finish, she accessorized with diamonds and strappy metallic hells. Reynolds, meanwhile, wore a classic black tuxedo, white dress shirt, and a bowtie. Tonight marked one of Lively’s first major public appearances since reports of a legal battle between her and her It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni emerged—a dispute which remains ongoing.

Inside the Stylish Weekend Celebrating Saturday Night Live’s 50th Anniversary,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/saturday-night-live-50th-anniversary-red-carpet,"February 16, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Saturday Night Live is marking a major milestone: This weekend, the iconic sketch comedy show from creator Lorne Michaels is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a slew of events in New York City. The festivities kicked off on Friday evening, with the SNL50: The Homecoming Concert at Radio City Music Hall. Naturally, the red carpet was a star-studded affair. Given SNL has welcomed hundreds of A-list hosts and musical guests over the years (it’s hard to think of a big star who hasn’t made a cameo on the show), it was only fitting that many celebrities joined the fun. Among those who walked the step and repeat on Friday were Miley Cyrus, Chris Pine, Christine Baranski—each one of them bringing some good, old-fashioned glitz and glamour to the party. Inside the historic venue, Lady Gaga performed “Shallow” with Andy Samberg, and did a funny bit to botch the song, before performing “Dick in a Box”—their 2009 SNL parody banger. Gaga, in a velvet black dress, stood with a zany giftbox taped to her waist—three guesses as to what they’re insinuating is inside. Miley Cyrus took to the stage in her gothic showgirl glory to perform “Flowers”, do a cover of Queen’s “Crazy Little Thing Called Love” with Brittany Howard, and shout that she loves Paul Rudd. Cher also performed “If I Could Turn Back Time,” well as Bad Bunny, Post Malone, The Backstreet Boys, The B-52’s, and Will Ferrell and Ana Gasteyer (who did their own hilarious versions of songs like Doechii’s “Denial is a River.” The celebrations continued on Sunday night, with the official SNL50: The Anniversary Special airing on NBC. Another step and repeat premiere was held for the release—and even more celebrities came out for the viewing party. Below, see all of the stars at SNL’s 50th-anniversary kickoff and how things went down inside. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

The Best Dressed Stars From the 2025 BAFTAs,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/best-dressed-stars-2025-baftas-red-carpet,"February 16, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"This evening in London, the 2025 BAFTAs marked the latest celebration of some of the last year’s best film and television projects—among them Wicked, Emilia Pérez, Anora, and Conclave. As such, the red carpet saw a bevy of A-list stars turn out for the affair (many of whom are also nominated for Academy Awards in March). The best dressed stars of the night? Those who leaned into New Hollywood glamour (yes, you read that right), choosing sculptural silhouettes and modernized finishes that felt fresh. Take Wicked star Cynthia Erivo, who went ethereal in her white macramé cotton lace bustier gown (with a breastplate that defied gravity—get it?). In McQueen, Demi Moore also turned heads in a dazzling gown that was reminiscent of stained glass, while Emilia Pérez star Selena Gomez chose a long, sleeveless gown by Schiaparelli Couture embroidered with silver sequins, crystals, rhinestones, and tassels—talk about disco ball dressing at its finest. As for some of the best dressed gents of the night? Colman Domingo reworked traditional suiting in a printed shirt and leather coat by Versace. Timothée Chalamet went sleek in all black Bottega Veneta—a refreshing switch-up from the bolder, more Y2K-leaning looks he has been wearing while promoting A Complete Unknown. (And isn’t that the making of a true fashion star—keeping us on our toes?) Below, see the best dressed stars from the 2025 BAFTAs. Is this your favorite look? Is this your favorite look?

Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner Do Matching Couple Style at the BAFTAs,https://www.vogue.com/article/timothee-chalamet-kylie-jenner-couple-style-baftas-2025,"February 16, 2025",By Olivia Allen,"With the 2025 BAFTAs in full swing, Timothée Chalamet has once again got us talking. Fresh off the A Complete Unknown press tour–zipping around on a Lime bike in Martine Rose and fully leaning into his Bob Dylan era—his latest look continues the streak. Over the weekend, he made waves at the Berlin Film Festival, out in Kendrick-inspired bootcut jeans and accompanying Kylie Jenner in a pink Chrome Hearts tracksuit—a stark contrast against his girlfriend’s glittering gown. For tonight’s red carpet, though, Timmy went for something a bit more classic. The best-actor nominee wore a double-breasted, all-black ensemble by Bottega Veneta—proving that sometimes simplicity really is best. It was a departure from his laidback athleisure looks this week, but felt like exactly the right choice for his moment in the limelight. While Jenner skipped the step and repeat (as she did at the Golden Globes and in Berlin), the beauty mogul was spotted inside the ceremony wearing a black embellished slip dress—perfectly matching Timothée’s sleek red carpet look.

Cynthia Erivo’s Louis Vuitton Breastplate Defies Gravity at the 2025 BAFTAs,https://www.vogue.com/article/cynthia-erivo-louis-vuitton-dress-baftas-2025,"February 16, 2025",By Olivia Allen,"Cynthia Erivo knows how to make an entrance, and she did just that at the 2025 BAFTAs tonight. In a white lace-embroidered Louis Vuitton gown, the Wicked star delivered a sculptural look that solidified her reputation for bold, red-carpet winning fashion. With its sharp architectural design, the dress was a statement that held space (get it?) from head to toe. While Erivo delivered a series of Elphaba-green looks during the Wicked press tour, the British actor has shifted towards a more monochrome colour palette during awards season—from the black-and-white floral gown she wore at the Golden Globes (also by Louis Vuitton) to the black sequined Armani Privè gown she wore at the Critics Choice Awards. Nominated for Best Actress at this year’s BAFTAs, Erivo’s transition from Broadway to film has been the stuff of legends—with three Oscars nominations under her belt, she’s solidified her place among Hollywood’s elite. As she gears up to co-host Vogue’s Fashion & Film party, it’s clear that Erivo is an unstoppable force both on screen and off. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Why Demi Moore’s Custom McQueen Gown at the 2025 BAFTAs Was a Perfect Choice,https://www.vogue.com/article/demi-moore-baftas-2025-alexander-mcqueen-dress,"February 16, 2025",By Kerry McDermott,"Creative director Seán McGirr recently told British Vogue that he wants his Alexander McQueen to be about youthful energy and “the animal within.” Which makes the Irish designer’s work a particularly apposite choice for Demi Moore, star of The Substance, in which a younger version of her character, Elisabeth Sparkle, literally bursts forth from her flesh in scenes gorier than any wildlife documentary. Moore, who is in the running for the Leading Actress BAFTA for her performance in the film, arrived at the 2025 ceremony tonight wearing a glittering halter-neck gown, featuring a graphic design. Evidently a fan of McGirr’s work, the star previously wore a shimmering black gown from his spring 2025 Alexander McQueen collection on the red carpet back in November. Demi has emerged as the toast of awards season, having already scooped a Golden Globe last month, her first major win (indeed her first nomination, as she noted in her acceptance speech) in some 45 years in the movie business. An emotional Moore, who described how she’d gotten used to being written off as a “popcorn actress” despite having one of the most enduring careers in Hollywood, told the crowd on the night that she was celebrating “being reminded that I do belong.” If she’s had to wait a while for recognition from her peers, Demi, who collected that Golden Globe in a shimmering strapless Armani Privé gown, has never been short of fashion plaudits. While she was crafting her own looks for her earliest red carpet appearances, at 62 she’s a regular on the front row (frequently accompanied by her almost equally feted pet dog, Pilaf), and she’s been known to appear on the runway, too. When Kim Jones was preparing to unveil his debut Fendi Haute Couture collection at the Palais Brongniart back in 2021, he cast supermodels Kate Moss, Christy Turlington and Naomi Campbell, but it was Demi he tasked with opening the show.

Mikey Madison’s Custom Prada Gown at the 2025 BAFTAs Confirms She’s Fashion’s Newest Star,https://www.vogue.com/article/mikey-madison-2025-baftas-prada-dress,"February 16, 2025",By Emily Chan,"Since emerging on the scene in breakout hit Anora, Mikey Madison has quickly established herself as a fashion girlie—from the vintage lace Dior gown that she and stylist Jamie Mizrahi picked out for the British Independent Film Awards, to the gold sequined Bottega Veneta gown that she wore to the Golden Globes, which came with the added clout of being creative director Matthieu Blazy’s last custom look for the brand. As is often a rite of passage for a buzzy emerging actor, Madison seems to have found a particular affinity, though, with Miuccia Prada’s creations: see the custom red off-shoulder gown that she wore to the Governors Awards, the crystal-embellished black velvet dress she sported at the London Film Festival, or the blush-pink old Hollywood style Miu Miu gown she opted for at the Palm Springs Film Festival. It’s perhaps no surprise, then, that Madison went for another custom Prada look at tonight’s BAFTAs: a white bustier dress with an embellished crystal scarf that delivered old-school Hollywood glamour, firmly establishing her role as one of fashion’s (and Hollywood’s) brightest new stars. It’s a busy night for Madison, who is not only up for Best Leading Actress at tonight’s awards ceremony, but also co-hosting British Vogue & GQ’s Fashion & Film Party.

It’s a fun one this year, too, with the likes of Demi Moore, Cynthia Erivo, and Mikey Madison nominated for Best Actress (the latter two also happen to be co-hosts for British Vogue & GQ’s Fashion & Film after-party), while Timothée Chalamet is nominated alongside Adrien Brody and Hugh Grant in the Best Actor race. Not only that, but pop-songstresses-turned-Hollywood-stars Selena Gomez and Ariana Grande are both up for Best Supporting Actress, while Succession co-stars Jeremy Strong and Kieran Culkin have received nods in the Best Supporting Actor category. Meanwhile, Irish hip-hop trio Kneecap has picked up nominations in six categories, including Outstanding British Film category, alongside queer crime thriller Love Lies Bleeding.

Looking For A Bespoke Suit in Palm Springs? At Paul Marlow You Have Come To The Right Place,https://www.vogue.com/article/paul-marlow-palm-springs,"February 15, 2025",By Mark Holgate,"Just when you think you've heard every life-after-Covid story, you hear yet one more—and this one has a very happy outcome. Paul Marlow, formerly of the design collective Loden Dager, a witty and clever menswear label known for riffing on classic Americana as much as it did achingly hip contemporary New York, is now opening a store in Palm Springs to showcase his decade and counting bespoke tailoring business. Though store seems a little prosaic. At the risk of sounding pretentious (me, I mean, not Marlow) experiential space is better. As well as his impeccable made to measure suiting, and his NYC-manufactured off the rack shirting, and the sweaters knitted in Scotland, there is vintage furniture, new textiles, Voutsa wallpaper, tabletop, candles, fragrance and last but by no means least a revolving roster of art shows, all presented in a vast industrial building sandwiched between two interior design studios. What Marlow has created is an environment that’s as cool as the summer midday Palm Springs sun is hot; that is, extremely. Marlow wants this space to feel curated but not to leave you feeling overstimulated; less, to his thinking, is more. Photo: Courtesy of Paul Marlow “It really feels like a great materialization of my life in an external format, what with the art, the interiors, the textiles, and the custom clothing,” Marlow says. “After Loden Dager closed, I turned to doing bespoke, to make a fresh start. And then I started doing ready to wear again during Covid when nobody wanted to come in and get measured. That’s when I picked up on the idea of opening a store. My friends have had their store on this strip for 20 years and they're downsizing, so they rented me one of their spaces—so it comes with a great community, a great family of people.” The idea of a store wasn’t exactly untested for him, though. Marlow still has his tailoring atelier in the former Loden Dager design studio on West 29th Street in New York, where people can drop by and hang out as much as they can be fitted for something to wear. In fact, with its industrial NYC workspace vibe personalized by Marlow’s extensive art and book collections, as well as his elegantly lived-in vintage furniture, his Manhattan space was a kind of aesthetic forerunner for what he has done in Palm Springs. Paul Marlow in his Palm Springs store. This tale of two cities is professional but also personal. Marlow ended up in Palm Springs because he and his partner, the theater director Joe Mantello, had gotten a place there, retreating to it during the pandemic; they liked the life, they liked the community, and they liked, says Marlow “that it's one of the few places left in America where you don't get frowned on for being gay.” With Mantello wanting to spend more time there, Marlow started making plans for his Palm Springs store. Except, he says, laughing, “Joe doesn't want to go back to New York unless he's working on a project, and now he has like five plays in the pipeline, so he'll be in New York a lot. And now that I have the store I will mostly be here.” Marlow is certainly going to be kept busy. There is, he says, a ready market for what he is doing. “There's this built-in clientele of an educated design customer who is looking for something special to wear,” he says. “The population here has been growing ever since Covid. It’s not like we will have people coming in who are looking for a Palm Springs t-shirt.” Though truth be told, a tee like that might look pretty great under one of his classic but never stuffy jackets. If his post fashion label life has taught him anything, he says, it’s that working with his clients (who now number well into the hundreds) it’s that design is, “a continual collaboration. It has actually changed the way I designed and the way I approach things,” he says. “I used to be designing a collection with one body type in mind; now I'm fitting one garment on one body at a time. And so I've learned so much more about tailoring and how to fit and accommodate people's desires while making them look good and feel good. And if you don't feel good in something, you shouldn't wear it. It makes me so happy to see people’s posture changes when they put something on that I've made.” Immersing himself in a different life experience from New York, and to be in a world of the outdoors and mid-century/modernist design has, he says, imbued his clothing, “with a cleaner, simpler take on things; the less embellishment, the longer things last. I don't follow trends. I'm really keeping it very less is more.” The backdrop for all of this is no less considered. “I really like the juxtaposition of a gritty down and dirty workspace,” Marlow says, “but with these moments of perfection and allowing for the imperfections to also be perfect.” The fitting room, with vintage kilim rugs, and art by British painter Lucien Rees Roberts. Photo: Courtesy of Paul Marlow Accompanying the clothing is plywood furniture of his own design, which he is looking to sell at some point, as well as vintage pieces: a 1940s French coffee table; Michel Boyer stools; a Studio Italia lamp, and, an original Eames Bikini chair. “Things will,” he says, “be cycling through. And Joe has an amazing eye; he has been grabbing stuff for me.” Adding to the feel of the space is the art. The first showing will be of British artist Lucien Rees Roberts (“He hasn’t had a show in ten years”), with shows coming up from Jack Ceglic, Leanne Shapton, and Gus Van Sant. (He and Marlow are friends and they play that most Palm Springs of sports together—golf). Yet the intention of all this is the same: to create a world that’s considered and thoughtful but also casual and easy. It’s most definitely not about the hard sell. “I'm really taking my time,” Marlow says. “And there's not a ton of product in the store right now, but that's intentional. I don't want to rush things. Too much can be too distracting.” PAUL MARLOW, 68929 Perez Road, Cathedral City, Palm Springs, CA 92234. Open Thu-Sun 12pm-4pm and by appointment More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

Miley Cyrus’s Gothic Showgirl Fits Deserve Their Flowers,https://www.vogue.com/article/miley-cyrus-saturday-night-life-50-anniversary-outfits,"February 15, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Lady Gaga! Cher! Lauryn Hill! Snoop Dogg! Miley Cyrus! All the stars comprised a megawatt line-up of performances for yesterday evening’s celebrations for Saturday Night Live’s 50th anniversary. But it was Miley Cyrus’s showgirl looks with a very Miley Cyrus-y twist that snatched our hearts. The evening at the historic Radio City Music Hall in New York kicked off a weekend of festivities for show creator Lorne Michael’s cultural institution SNL. Ayo Edebiri, Anya Taylor-Joy, Amy Poehler, Jenna Ortega, Emily Ratajkowski, Chris Pine, Christine Baranski, Pete Davidson, and many others stepped out for the evening—the crowd was glitzy and very glam. Cyrus was among those performing, bringing her powerhouse vocals and trademark breezy, assured attitude. She sang her Grammy award-winning hit “Flowers” and gave playful shout out to all her buddies in the crowd: “I love you Paul Rudd!” Cyrus exclaimed. The camera panned to Rudd blowing a kiss. “Are y’all doing that Grammys thing where you guys are famous and shit and you don’t sing along…Excuse my language?” Anya Taylor-Joy and Pedro Pascal put that to bed, shown enthusiastically singing and dancing along. Cyrus also performed a cover of Queen’s “Crazy Little Thing Called Love” with Brittany Howard. The musician first took to the red carpet, wearing an all-black Roberto Cavalli gown. The leather dress had layers of winged cut-outs and a floatier tulle train that extended into a mermaid tail. It’s from the Italian house’s spring summer 2025 collection by Fausto Puglisi, and which Eva Herzigova wore on the runway. Cyrus styled it with Paris Texas lace-up black stilettos, and kept her brown and blonde highlighted hair tousled. She walked the carpet with mother Tish Cyrus and boyfriend Maxx Morando. Later for her performance, Cyrus once again opted for close-fitting, cut-out dominant Cavalli—but this time, it was an archive piece from the brand’s spring summer 2004 collection. The black dress fit close to her form, with diamond cut-outs and a feathered, sparkling skirt that gave her the showgirl dynamism necessary on stage. She commanded the show, with every shimmy, vocal swoop, and feather shake. Cyrus worked with her go-to regular stylist, Bradley Kenneth, for the affair. Kenneth has been dressing Cyrus in a succession of sultry, monochrome gowns by way of custom Yves Saint Laurent and Alaïa, Celine and Schiaparelli. Elsewhere across the evening, Gaga performed “Shallow” with Andy Samberg, and did a funny bit to botch the song, before performing “Dick in a Box”—their 2009 SNL parody banger. Gaga, in a velvet black dress, stood with a zany giftbox taped to her waist—three guesses as to what they’re insinuating is inside. Cher also performed “If I Could Turn Back Time,” well as Bad Bunny, Post Malone, The Backstreet Boys, The B-52’s, and Will Ferrell and Ana Gasteyer (who did their own hilarious versions of songs like Doechii’s “Denial is a River.” A fantastical evening, built around Cyrus’s super special performances and gothic showgirl wonder outfits—flowers for Miley!

Saoirse Ronan’s Latest Look Proves the Color Analysis Trend Works,https://www.vogue.com/article/saoirse-ronan-blue-louis-vuitton-dress-iftas,"February 15, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Saoirse Ronan’s style shift has been awe-inducing. Working with stylist Danielle Goldberg—a collaborator of filmic fashion girls Ayo Edebiri and Greta Lee too—Ronan has developed an elegant and understated, yet subversive set of sartorial codes. Think J.W Anderson asymmetric mini-dresses and archival Phoebe Philo-era Celine, pops of color and texture, and incorporating new-gen designers like Hodakova and Colleen Allen into the wardrobe. The actor’s latest outing adds to a thrilling stylistic oeuvre—and proves both she and Goldberg know the colors that work best for her. The Irish Film & Television Academy Awards took place in Dublin on Friday (February 14), celebrating the year in Irish film and television. Some of Ireland’s biggest names turned out for the ceremony, including Ronan, Cillian Murphy, Andrew Scott, Ruth Negga, Nicola Coughlan, and Sharon Horgan. For the occasion, Goldberg dressed The Outrun actor in custom Louis Vuitton by Nicolas Ghesquière. She wore the bold blue strapless gown with an empire waist and single pleat and kept to minimal accessories, with a set of Completedworks black drop earrings. Her hair was in a middle parting and tight bun, by Irish hairstylist Aidan Darcy, with a rose pink lip and a sweep of eyeliner by Vivien Pomeroy. Ronan is most certainly aware of what suits her on the color wheel. The royal blue shade and other hues of bright and more muted blue have cropped up in her wardrobe before: a J.W Anderson mini-dress, a silken navy Ferragamo shirt, and a puffball sleeve and skirted Louis Vuitton dress. A more electric shade of blue was even the color of her hair in her film The Outrun. Saoirse Ronan was one of the IFTA night’s most major names, winning two awards: Best Lead Actress for The Outrun, and Best Supporting Actress for Blitz. Proving blue is a winner’s color, will we see the shade carry her through to the weekend’s BAFTAs? More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Lisa Elevates Method Dressing for ‘The White Lotus’ in a Way Only She Can,https://www.vogue.com/article/lisa-white-lotus-dress-method-dressing,"February 15, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Check-in time! The White Lotus’s third season is imminent, and Lisa isn’t here to play. Method dressing has been a longstanding red carpet theme, that kicked off with Margot Robbie’s Barbie campaign and slalomed Wicked’s Ariana (Glinda) Grande and Timothée Chalamet’s Bob Dylan cosplay. But we can confidently say Lisa has brought the trend to full bloom. Set in a glam resort in Thailand, the third season of Mike White’s hit show will premiere this Sunday (February 16), and stars the likes of Lisa, Parker Posey, Leslie Bibb, Natasha Rothwell, and Carrie Coon. The cast swapped the loose and light holiday gear for their most elegant formalwear at the Los Angeles premiere, and jetted back out to Thailand for another glamorous affair. Lisa, adored for her Blackpink oeuvre and her own solo musical material (stream Alter Ego), is now a first-time actor. She’s been making the most of the promo run with an elegant array of looks. Last night (February 14), she attended the premiere afterparty at the Four Seasons Hotel Bangkok at Chao Phraya River, dressed as an actual lotus flower. The striking look consisted of a strapless, pale yellow mini-dress with a silver sash and crystal off-the-shoulder details. Posing expertly on the red carpet, her dress blended in with the backdrop’s unfurling lotus flower to create a striking look. Of course, Lisa knows how to work the stage to fulfil the fantasy. She finished the look with delicate gold sandals, and a watch that looked like a corsage. She kept her enviable bangs long and her hair in a loose updo. For the Los Angeles premiere, Lisa wore the similarly soft, pale yellow tone. She wore a regal Miss Sohee Couture gown that featured a fitted, sheer pearl-studded bodice with princessy cap sleeves that flowed into a silk-chiffon skirt with layers. The skirt had crystal top layers that overlapped like a flower petals. In her hand, she carried a single white lotus. Both looks seem to make a subtle and understated reference to the yellow American lotus flower. Her second look at the Thailand affair was a bright fuchsia set: a strapless cropped top with an attached bolero and a fitted skirt with a flowing taffeta train, and matching pumps. It was somewhat of an update on Marilyn Monroe’s Gentleman Prefer Blondes look—but most interestingly, it’s in the hue of Thailand’s own lotus flower strain. The flower is a symbol of purity, faithfulness, and spiritual awakening in Thailand, coming from The Red Lotus Sea, known in Thai as Talee Bua Daeng. Lisa plays Mook, a health-guru like figure at the Thailand beach resort. Mook finds herself entangled in a romantic friendship with one of the resort’s security guards, Gaitok (played by Tayme Thapthimthong). Speaking to Variety, Lisa said that Mook is quite like she is, “but flirtier and lady-like—I’m more like a tomboy.” Speaking to press at the LA event, she said: “It is my first acting [experience] so I don’t know what to expect on set, but everybody just being so supportive helped me a lot. So thank you, everyone.” Regardless, Lisa’s red carpet transformation continues to blossom. Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

The Top 8 Spring 2025 Fashion Trends You Can Shop and Wear Now,https://www.vogue.com/article/spring-2025-fashion-trends,"February 14, 2025",By Madeline Fass,"All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors. However, we may earn affiliate revenue on this article and commission when you buy something. While strong notions of femininity prevailed in the spring/summer collections, the spring/summer 2025 fashion trends we’re predicting to take over the fashion landscape are less ethereal and dreamy as they are practical and empowering. Rooted in a sense of “soft power,” which Vogue’s Laird Borelli-Persson connected to designers encouraging “an openness to a sense of wonder” in her analysis of the shows, these trends can be embraced in more ways than one. And key themes can already be incorporated into your wardrobe. Consider spring’s outerwear stories, which reimagine lightweight jackets of all types, particularly sporty styles for the season ahead. For inspiration on how to wear these jackets from now, look no further than Bottega, where an elasticated windbreaker was styled with fluid trousers. A zip-up à la Gucci works equally well here—just throw an overcoat on top. Suede will continue to trend as well, so if you invested last fall, keep wearing it! Dark chocolate brown styles pair particularly nicely with spring’s softer color palette of wispy pinks and pale yellows. As for the print that reigned supreme on the spring/summer runways? It wasn’t a floral or an animal but plaid, and its first cousin, gingham. The autumnal pattern was already a favorite last fall, and it seems like fashion wasn’t done with it for spring, rendering it in softer colors and shapes. If you wardrobe already has a spirited amount of checks, look to the runways for ideas on how to print clash—another major theme this spring that was put forward at Dries Van Noten, Gucci, and Miu Miu, where high-impact, retro-inspired prints were piled on in an artfully chaotic manner. (If it looks wrong, it’s probably right.) These and more key spring/summer 2025 fashion trends to know and shop now as spring deliveries land in stores. Runway: Miu Miu Spring 2025; Rabanne Spring 2025; Prada Spring 2025; Tory Burch Spring 2025; Proenza Schouler Spring 2025 Inspired by sunny weekends on the coast, but really foil for any kind of weather or locale, the abundance of seaside-inspired pieces offer imaginative dressing solutions that are both practical and seasonally appropriate. Key pieces include anything with a sailor stripe, buoyant cotton skirts and dresses, and wind-resistant jackets—it does get blustery out there! Proenza Schouler Yves stripe fringed knit dress BERGDORF GOODMAN Miu Miu Panama cotton and technical pongé blouson jacket MIU MIU Nili Lotan Noemi lace-up striped cashmere hoodie NET-A-PORTER SHOPBOP Jil Sander pleated twill wide-leg pants NET-A-PORTER Tory Burch mini cotton dress TORY BURCH NET-A-PORTER Prada pleated midiskirt SAKS FIFTH AVENUE Runway: Versace Spring 2025; Dries Van Noten Spring 2025; Valentino Spring 2025; Miu Miu Spring 2025; Gucci Spring 2025 Maximalists will always have print, and this season encourages us to revisit the art of the clash with retro-inspired patterns. A devil-may-care approach will be rewarded here, but if your less-is-more tendencies are too strong to rebel against, a graphic top or skirt (ideally one that looks, or is, vintage) will do trick. Denim with trims, per Valentino, can achieve the same mix-and-match effect. Versace Wave jacquard knit fitted polo shirt VERSACE Dries Van Noten satin-jacquard midi skirt NET-A-PORTER SSENSE Miu Miu double-breasted printed natté coat MIU MIU Chloé lace-trimmed silk tiered slipdress SAKS FIFTH AVENUE NET-A-PORTER SSENSE Gucci printed silk shirt with self-tie GUCCI Valentino metallic jacquard-trimmed straight-leg jeans NET-A-PORTER SAKS FIFTH AVENUE FWRD Runway: Khaite Spring 2025; Proenza Schouler Spring 2025; Diotima Spring 2025; Alaïa Spring 2025; Carven Spring 2025 Texture, fringe, and crochet can do much for a minimalist wardrobe with very little. The idea here isn’t to do away with the clean line entirely, but rather play up those refrained sensibilities with novelty and craft. Even purists will enjoy styling these pieces. Khaite Avalon dress KHAITE Diotima Darliston skirt FWRD High Sport Louis fringed cotton-blend jacquard straight-leg pants NET-A-PORTER Simkhai Sonia fringe knit dress SIMKHAI MODA OPERANDI Mango silk blouse with asymmetrical neckline MANGO Proenza Schouler Phia skirt in leather silk fringe PROENZA SCHOULER Runway: Victoria Beckham Spring 2025; Issey Miyake Spring 2025; Bally Spring 2025; Loewe Spring 2025; Tod’s Spring 2025 Sculptural shapes alluding to a Japanese-style minimalism will inspire you to look differently at your everyday staples. These boisterous, asymmetric, and fanned-out silhouettes offer a true fashion POV to pieces you might wear everyday, from white T-shirts to nipped-in jackets. Khaite Nando jacket KHAITE Bally wool-blend midiskirt LUISA VIA ROMA Loewe draped T-shirt LOEWE Jacquemus Agave drop-waist pleated flare mididress BERGDORF GOODMAN Magda Butrym wool and silk-blend peplum blazer NET-A-PORTER Alaïa peplum wide-leg pants FWRD Runway: Loewe Spring 2025; Valentino Spring 2025; Marina Moscone Spring 2025; Alexander McQueen Spring 2025; Erdem Spring 2025 Soft pastels brought romance and airiness to the runways, but the color palette didn’t feel overly feminine. Even minimalists will be drawn to this season’s wispy pinks and pale yellows, which look great against wardrobe neutrals like grey, navy, and even chocolate brown suede. Alexander McQueen women's plissé blouse ALEXANDER MCQUEEN Oscar de la Renta tiered floral-print silk-blend georgette mini dress NET-A-PORTER Simone Rocha ruffle frill multi-seam maxi dress SSENSE Ulla Johnson Eve dress ULLA JOHNSON Acne Studios layered distressed chiffon and floral-print crepe skirt NET-A-PORTER Banana Republic chiffon twist-neck top BANANA REPUBLIC Runway: Loewe Spring 2025; Bottega Veneta Spring 2025; Prada Spring 2025; Miu Miu Spring 2025; Gucci Spring 2025 A sporty sensibility carried over from fashion’s Olympics fervor pervaded the spring/summer 2025 runways. Sabato de Sarno showed various fitted zip-up jackets at Gucci, while Bottega and Miu Miu reimagined the wind breaker—Matthieu Blazy notably lined his in plaid, a carryover from fall we’ll get into next. But other kinds of lightweight outerwear were anlso introduced. At Prada, Miuccia and Raf Simons showed a suede style, proof that fashion’s ongoing obsession with the texture isn’t going anywhere. A cropped leather cape made an appearance at Loewe, upleveling the boho staple we were reacquainted with last spring. Investing in next-season outerwear now doesn’t mean you have to wait until March to wear your pieces—layer similar styles from Gucci and Loewe under heavier coats to maximize their cost per wear. Gucci embroidered wool and silk hooded jacket GUCCI Sacai twill-paneled hoodie MYTHERESA & Other Stories belted patch-pocket jacket & OTHER STORIES Loewe balloon jacket in nappa lambskin LOEWE Miu Miu Technical silk zipper jacket MIU MIU Skall Studio Gaby jacket FWRD Runway: Acne Studios Spring 2025; Kallmeyer Spring 2025; Tod’s Spring 2025; The Row Spring 2025; Bottega Veneta Spring 2025 Plaid may be synonymous with fall—where it indeed saw a resurgence this season—but its presence in the spring collections takes on a softer tune. Borelli-Persson described these checks best as “Nirvana meets Country Living… for any season or type of weather” in her trend report. The Row’s ‘Tavishina’ coat in look 29 exemplifies the fashion mood, with an energizing combination of beige, black, and baby blue squares that was styled with pinstripe pants and a plain white button-up for a harmonious, minimalist-approved take on print mixing. Blazy meanwhile played with a classic color scheme of browns, greys, and white, but showed it as an oversized shacket meets coat hybrid. At Tod’s checks were playfully introduced once more, worn inside out as a full ensemble. In New York, Daniella Kallmeyer furthered the artful drape with a fluid blouse, while Acne Studios dabbled in the art of the clash (nails included!) and incorporated another theme seen in the resort 2025 trends: the bubble hem. This ’90s-inspired look can be achieved now with printed pieces from the likes of Massimo Dutti, Ralph Lauren, or Zara—and styled with pattern opposites for a true runway-coded look. The Row Tavishina coat THE ROW Bottega Veneta gingham cotton dress BOTTEGA VENETA High Sport Asher gingham jacquard top NET-A-PORTER Posse Mackenzie trousers POSSE Loewe cropped plaid shirt LOEWE Zara gingham midiskirt ZARA Runway: Tory Burch Spring 2025; Stella McCartney Spring 2025; Bottega Veneta Spring 2025; Saint Laurent Spring 2025; Bally Spring 2025 We’re leaving the office siren behind for spring, and embracing new tailoring codes for 2025. Simone Bellotti suggested a nipped in peplum shape with drop shoulders at Bally, Stella McCartney went ’80s oversize, Tory Burch introduced a collarless, belted, and wrapped silhouette, and Blazy showed an almost cartoonishly oversize take at Bottega. A happy medium can be found at Saint Laurent, where the many full suiting looks in the collection were inspired by the house founder, and meant to convey “control and power,” as designer Anthony Vaccarello told Vogue’s Mark Holgate post-show backstage.

I Need Celebrities to Stop Changing Clothes Every Five Seconds,https://www.vogue.com/article/i-need-celebrities-to-stop-changing-clothes-every-five-seconds,"February 14, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Last week, Anya Taylor-Joy spent the day running around New York City to promote her forthcoming film The Gorge. In one day alone, the actor wore five separate outfits—ranging from a sensational Alexander McQueen shearling coat to a mod Celine skirt suit and a brown leather Loewe trapeze jacket. Taylor-Joy is far from the only celebrity to change outfits at light speed: Keke Palmer, Blake Lively, and Sydney Sweeney have all recently churned out scores of looks in a short amount of time. Beyond street style, awards shows and red carpets have become an opportunity for outfit changes galore. At the Grammys, Doechii and Chappell Roan were among the artists to switch up their looks—Doechii in a parade of custom Thom Browne, Roan in a series of rodeo clown-inspired outfits. Recently, the speed at which celebrities change clothing seems to be reaching terminal velocity. Sure, there is a logic behind this phenomenon: they are usually in the throes of a press tour, taping junkets, talk shows, and social spots on a condensed timeline. Changing outfits offers the illusion that celebrities have more hours in the day than the rest of us, that they can fulfill endless professional obligations. Why, after all, would we want to know that an actor did GMA, a Buzzfeed puppy interview, and Hot Ones all in the same day? That would shatter the fantasy of promotional work as breezy and fun. Meanwhile, when it comes to awards shows, a roster of outfit changes can tell a story and convey power, something both Doechii and Chappell Roan executed at the Grammys. Both singers, nominated for Best New Artist, pulled off major fashion flexes in what the Recording Academy considers their freshman year: Roan changed from archival Jean Paul Gaultier couture into custom Thom Browne, while Doechii rocked four custom looks (also by Browne) over the course of the evening. But, be it street style or red carpet dressing, constantly changing outfits dilutes the power of the fashion. One can only imagine all of the time and effort that goes into making or procuring a garment—sourcing, shipping, tailoring—just for it to be worn for only a few minutes. It also causes red carpet moments to lose their salience. After all, who cares what a celebrity is wearing on the red carpet when we know they’re about to head inside and change? It’s not a problem contained to the fashion industry. We as a culture have a voracious appetite for newness, constant stimulation. But this ecosystem of nonstop changing is wildly unsustainable in terms of the environment, labor, and time. Going forward, celebrities and their stylists would be better served curating fashion moments that promote quality over quantity. After all, we only have so many hours in the day: why waste it changing every hour when one great look is all it takes?

Timothée Chalamet Takes a Page Out of Kendrick Lamar’s Book in Bootcut Jeans,https://www.vogue.com/article/timothee-chalamet-bootcut-jeans-kendrick-lamar,"February 14, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Timothée Chalamet is the latest male celebrity to hop aboard the bootcut jean train. Following Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime performance in light wash Celine flares, we began to wonder: Will men buy into the look? Chalamet is answering with a resounding yes. Today, Chalamet continued his endless press tour for A Complete Unknown at the Berlinale. Braving the snowy Berlin weather, the Oscar nominee cocooned himself in a vintage yellow and black striped Columbus Crew Adidas zip-up. He also expended his ever-growing scarf collection with the pièce de résistance of all scarves: a white Alexander McQueen printed with black skulls. But the real star of the show (no pun intended) was Chalamet’s light wash bootcut jeans, which pooled around his Asics: The pants were studded with moons and stars, adding some celestial flair to his already maximalist look. The bold jeans are from Kikunobu in Japan. Given that he was just in the country for more press, it’s possible he picked them up while traveling. Seeing as Chalamet and Lamar share the same stylist, Taylor McNeill, it’s not a huge surprise to see the actor rocking a similar pair of pants. But there are key differences: while Lamar’s Celine jeans clung to his thighs before flaring out below the knee, Chalamet’s fit looser on his body, though there is still a noticeable flare. While there’s been plenty of discourse about the difference between flare and bootcut jeans, we’ll have to place Chalamet in the bootcut camp for now. Regardless, it’ll give him and Lamar lots to discuss next time they link up. Later on in the evening, Chalamet slipped into something a little more comfortable. With his girlfriend Kylie Jenner joining him in Berlin, he honored the holiday in a custom pale pink ensemble from Chrome Hearts. Looking like a lost cast member from Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, Chalamet wore a tank top and trousers with a hoodie and even a pair of matching pink lug sole boots. He accessorized with a resplendent diamond tennis necklace from Cartier and a long-stemmed pink rose in hand. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. The couple settled in for a V-day date night at the German premiere of A Complete Unknown, sitting beside each other in the cinema room and sharing a kiss.

Lady Gaga and Anya Taylor-Joy Cosign the Return of the Can Can Boot,https://www.vogue.com/article/lady-gaga-and-anya-taylor-joy-cosign-the-return-of-the-can-can-boot,"February 14, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"It should come as no surprise that A Star Is Born lead Lady Gaga is a musical theater afficionado. But the singer even managed to incorporate a nod into her latest look. Yesterday, Gaga arrived at rehearsals for SNL’s 50th anniversary special dressed in an austere all-black look from Willy Chavarria’s fall 2025 collection: a black midi coat dress with a structured shoulder, swishy hem, and white kerchief peeking out of her breast pocket. But we couldn’t help but notice the singer’s shoes: a pair of pointy-toe lace-up booties—Jimmy Choo’s Scarlett boots, to be exact. The calf-high boot looked like a high-fashion reimagining of the Can Can boot, or something worn by a very chic member of The Music Man cast. Anya Taylor-Joy and Malcolm McRae in New York. Great minds think alike, it turns out. Last night, Anya Taylor-Joy also sported a pair of lace-up boots while attending Danielle Haim’s birthday party at Joyface in Manhattan’s East Village—albeit a much different interpretation. Taylor-Joy chose a pair of banana yellow KNWLS boots, complete with a pointy toe, buckle detail, and exaggerated tongue. The statement-making shoes served as a bright pop of color against her brown suede trench coat and black leather gloves.

How to Choose the Best Glasses for Your Face Shape,https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-choose-the-best-glasses-for-your-face-shape,"February 14, 2025",By Jessie Heyman,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. I’ve always had trouble with glasses. While I find them adorable—even chic!—on other people, I’ve long felt that once I put on a pair, my look becomes very “finals week,” very quickly. For years, I tried to turn a blind eye to the whole thing, blithely waving at strangers and squinting at street signs. But it was only a matter of time, I knew, before I had to succumb to spectacles. (Also: Because I’m not one for touching my eyes, contacts were a non-starter.) So, I gave myself a mission: If I was to become a glasses person, I simply needed to find the best pair out there. We’ve seen how they can be a powerful, even evocative accessory. (Meryl Streep has practically made a career out of the dramatic handling of eyewear.) And there’s never been a shortage of design-forward options—just look at the spring runways, where sultry little spectacles abound. To wit: Just last week, the Khaite show accessorized chunky knits, smart trousers, and tailored jackets with ascot caps, sharp handbags, and a sprinkling of elegant eyewear. As Vogue Runway Director Nicole Phelps wrote in her review, designer Catherine Holstein’s success at Khaite comes down to how good she is with product. “Look around at the front rows during fashion month and a good percentage of women will be wearing her Nevada boots,” Phelps wrote, “others are carrying her Simona shoulder bag, or wearing her jeans.” Now, Khaite has added optical eyewear to its collection of covetable staples. A look from the recent Khaite collection, featuring the brand's new eyewear. Created in collaboration with the heritage eyewear brand Oliver Peoples, which also helped to launch Khaite’s debut sunglasses collection in the fall of 2023, the new line is made up of six styles in all, featuring three pairs of opticals: two cat-eyed silhouettes (one in metal, the other in a bold acetate) and a ‘70s-inspired oversized pair. Eagle-eyed fashion folk may recognize the golden corewire that runs the length of the frame as a nod to the hardware in Khaite’s bags. All three styles feel like a natural extension of Khaite’s signature cool-but-wearable look. “There’s a quiet confidence to opticals, a refinement that is part of your daily uniform,” Holstein tells Vogue. “We wanted these frames to feel inherently Khaite—understated and intentional.” My vision may be blurry, but even I can see that there has never been a better time to give glasses a go. I traveled to Oliver Peoples’s Madison Avenue shop to try some on. Below, the best tips for choosing truly inspired eyewear. There’s a bit of a science to choosing your ideal glasses shape—though it’s a deeply individual practice. George Lee, who has worked with Oliver Peoples for 12 years, breaks down the formula for selecting the most flattering eyeglasses for different face shapes. It’s all about balance: While those with triangular faces—characterized by a wider forehead and smaller chin—should opt for smaller frames, a narrower forehead and wider jawline are well served by larger frame. Similarly, if you have a square face, Lee suggests picking frames that are a bit rounded, to give your visage a touch of softness; and for round faces, square-shaped glasses will give your look greater definition. Generally speaking, you don’t want your glasses to obscure your brows: Ideally, the top of the frame will follow the brow bone and fall slightly below your eyebrows. As far as your coloring goes, the rule of thumb is to try to create contrast, but if you’re new to the optical game, something classic—say, a relatively thin oval or soft square acetate frame in black or tortoiseshell—will do just fine. If you are blessed with a lower prescription, your frames can come in virtually any size or style. Higher prescriptions, on the other hand, narrow the field a bit, tending to require smaller frames with thicker edges. Lee is careful about how many frames he shows each client; he doesn’t tend to pull more than 10-12 in total, so as not to overwhelm them with options. He also thinks it’s best to try glasses on solo, rather than choosing by committee. (Selfies, however, are fair game, and I’d suggest industriously circulating all options among your trusted council.) Just like clothing, eyewear is ultimately an extension of your taste and style: What makes a pair of glasses “good” comes down to what makes you happy. In my case, I followed Lee’s step-by-step guidance and selected a pair of delicately rounded specs that gave my brows plenty of room to breathe and balanced out (but didn’t overwhelm) my oval-shaped face. Their color—tortoiseshell with an ivory interior—played off both my lighter complexion and dark hair. Looking at my reflection, it was the first time I’d ever felt like myself in a pair of glasses. “Eyewear is about how you want to look as well as what’s flattering,” Lee told me at the end of our tutorial. “If you can combine that with what works aesthetically, it really hits.” Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1978RX eyeglasses OLIVER PEOPLES Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1953RX eyeglasses KHAITE Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1953RX eyeglasses KHAITE Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1998RX eyeglasses KHAITE Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1978RX eyeglasses OLIVER PEOPLES Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1953RX eyeglasses KHAITE Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1998RX eyeglasses KHAITE Khaite x Oliver Peoples 1953RX eyeglasses OLIVER PEOPLES Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

Allow Zoë Kravitz to Introduce the Winter Sandal,https://www.vogue.com/article/zoe-kravitz-winter-sandal,"February 14, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"The snow from this week’s storm hasn’t even melted in New York City, but that didn’t stop Zoë Kravitz from breaking out her summer sandals. The actor and director arrived at Danielle Haim’s birthday party alongside Cara Delevingne and her Big Little Lies costar Shailene Woodley. While all of them bundled up for the blustery weather, Kravitz wasn’t going to let the cold stop her sartorial vision. She styled a pair of black leather kitten heeled ankle strap sandals with low-denier black tights. The open-toed shoe in freezing temps wasn’t the only so-called “fashion rule” that Kravitz broke last night. She bundled up in a calf-length black coat, which she paired with a navy blue fringed scarf. While the notion that one can’t wear black and navy together is outdated, here it serves as a reminder that Kravitz is wont to do what she pleases—rules (and snow) be damned. The actor finished off her look with a simple black leather envelope bag from Saint Laurent complete with a gold crossbody chain, which she matched to her smattering of gold jewelry. Amidst a sea of partygoers in wild outfits galore, Zoë Kravitz reminded us that sometimes breaking the rules can be a quiet act.

The 17 Most Stylish Celebrity Valentines,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/the-17-most-stylish-celebrity-valentines,"February 14, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Here at Vogue, there’s nothing we love more than a stylish celebrity couple. Personal style obviously conveys a great deal about the wearer, but a couple’s style gives us a peek into their dynamic. On one end of the spectrum, we have duos like Tom Holland and Zendaya, who are all in on coordination—be it their errands ’fits or their event looks. On the other end is Hailey Bieber and Justin Bieber, who often look as though they got dressed with entirely different briefs. The current reigning champions of celebrity couple style are Rihanna and A$AP Rocky, who never miss an opportunity to flex their fashion muscles. At the 2024 Fashion Awards, Rocky opted for an understated navy Bottega Veneta suit while Rihanna chose a dramatic vintage Christian Lacroix number complete with a feathered hat. And that’s nothing to say of their impeccable date night style, which they regularly flaunt on the streets of New York and Los Angeles. Red carpet couple style is an art form of its very own. At the 2024 Emmys, Saoirse Ronan and Jack Lowden made their red carpet debut as a married couple after secretly tying the knot in July. For their first appearance, Ronan met the moment in a navy blue draped Louis Vuitton two-piece, while Lowden coordinated in a matching navy tuxedo with black lapels. Meanwhile, on the 2024 Met Gala carpet, Queen Latifah and Eboni Nichols made a splash in custom Thom Browne. Happy Valentine’s Day from Vogue!

Jennifer Lawrence Adds a Maternity Wardrobe Must-Have to Her Outfit Rotation,https://www.vogue.com/article/jennifer-lawrence-maternity-wardrobe-track-pants,"February 14, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Up against the sartorial challenge of braving the frigid New York weather and dressing for the final trimester of pregnancy, Jennifer Lawrence comes up tops. Over the last several months, Jennifer Lawrence’s maternity wardrobe has run the gamut: bump-hugging LBDs and comfy but still cool shoes, adapted modern classics, archival couture and a good measure of excellent denim—all while never losing sight of her key colors and long-loved labels of choice. The actor was photographed out in New York City once again running some errands and braving the relentless chill, relying on a rotation of reworn pieces that included a blue lumberjack-check shirt and oversized leather jacket. A new and necessary addition to Lawrence’s maternity wardrobe was a pair of cobalt blue and yellow track pants. Comfortable, cool, and matching her phone case. Lawrence also wore her hair in thick plaits, and donned a pair of orange lensed, oval sunglasses. Track pants are a key staple for anyone’s wardrobe, easily pulled on to run to the shops and dressed up for easy elevation with cool layers, other textures and patterns, if you’re to follow J-Law’s style codes. The striking shade of blue is becoming a bit of a calling card for Lawrence, overtaking her love of a “pop of red.” Cobalt has been punctuating her looks of more muted tones—an easy style trick to polish any outfit. Jennifer Lawrence dons her new shade of choice. The classic flannel is also a regular reach for Lawrence: whether in this lumberjack style or a gingham check. And with temperatures set to stay freezing, she’ll remain ensconced in her enviable coat collection too. The overarching theme of J-Law’s maternity closet? Snuggly-chic.

"10 Seasons In, the Black in Fashion Council Discovery Showroom Continues to Transform the Industry",https://www.vogue.com/article/fall-2025-black-in-fashion-council-discovery-showroom,"February 13, 2025",By Jasmine Fox-Suliaman,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. On the surface, one could surmise that things have shifted for the better in the fashion industry for Black creatives in the last few seasons. We’ve seen a massive influx of private investment into small businesses, 28 major retailers signed onto the Fifteen Percent Pledge to stock-list Black-owned brands, and history was made when Maximilian Davis and Pharrell Williams were appointed as the first Black creative directors for their respective fashion houses, Ferragamo and Louis Vuitton. But still, given the current political climate, it’s clear for many that the work has only just begun—at least that was our consensus after chatting with designers at the Black in Fashion Council’s Fall 2025 Discovery Showroom. Despite ongoing discussions around the importance of diversity in fashion, the industry itself is still largely exclusionary. Only 7% to 10% of small fashion businesses are Black owned; of that slim margin, only 1% is currently sold in major retailers. If that weren’t emblematic enough of a systemic imbalance, one only needs to look at who is appointed to the lofty positions in major luxury fashion houses to notice the lack of actual change. As reported by Vogue Business, only eight women and four people of color currently hold creative director roles at the major luxury fashion houses, none of which is held by a Black woman. That staggering reality was something that came up at this season’s showroom as designer Nia Thomas admitted, “There’s not a lot of examples for me to look up to as an African American woman working in the luxury fashion industry in the United States, so I’ve come to accept that maybe I have to break down some of those barriers myself.” It wasn’t just one designer who voiced this concern, as even a late-night call with Rene Moshi Macdonald of Lisou led her to question why a major fashion house has yet to name a Black woman to a creative director post. “What the hell is that all about?” she asked. For all of the perceived “progression” that occurred the past few years, it’s become clear to many Black creatives that the only way forward isn’t to continue asking for a seat at the table but to build their own spaces from the jump. One could argue that perspective has been the guiding principle behind why Sandrine Charles and Lindsay Peoples started the Black in Fashion Council. While other organizations have floundered to create such a space in the existing ecosystem, the Council has flourished by creating its own. Over the past five years, the organization has given a platform to more than 75 designers from across the globe, including Diotima, Theophilio, and House of Aama. While its longevity is worth celebrating—which was done so with a dinner party—it’s not lost on the founders that there’s still more work to do in the industry. “We are thrilled to reach the milestone of 10 seasons hosting the Black in Fashion Council Discovery Showroom, but our goal moving forward is to continue to evolve the showroom efforts, the designer footprint, and the overall experience,” Charles told Vogue at the fall 2025 presentation. While systemic change in the broader fashion industry will no doubt take time to achieve, the showcase has been a conduit for building community. Whether hailing from the shores of Haiti or a few stops into the borough of Brooklyn, creatives have come together consecutively to create meaningful relationships at the Council. It’s that connection that compelled Vogue to shuffle through the snow down to Manhattan’s Financial District on a particularly frigid afternoon during New York Fashion Week to interview each of them. Ahead, the 10 designers discuss their labels, what the showcase means to them, and their vision for the future of fashion. “I’ve always been a texture freak,” Nia Thomas unabashedly admitted as she talked us through the inspiration behind her fall 2025 collection. Like most New York–born designers, Thomas has a terrific sense of humor that allows her to poke fun at herself. But make no mistake: Her work is no laughing matter. Thomas has built her namesake brand over the past seven years by wielding artisan techniques to transform some of the most unyielding textiles into creations that beg to be touched. Although she’s become known for her crochet knitwear, she stretched her skill set into new terrain this season by debuting her first-ever leather pieces. Arguably some of her most substantial work yet, small strips of lilac leather were strung together to create a see-through halter top; saffron leather fringe was used to create a slip dress resemblant of a fishing net; and even the traditional woven handbag was given a scrumptious update in the tiny chocolate brown tote. But her ingenuity didn’t end with her leatherwork, as even the most perfunctory everyday items couldn’t seem to escape her grip—e.g., silk ribbons sourced from an office supply closing sale in Mexico City were inevitably woven into a sleek floor-length gown. No matter the source material, every tiny detail seemed to exemplify Thomas’s aspiration: to create her own tangible world that you could touch. Serendipitously, a year before the Detroit-born designer Aaron Potts was asked to partake in Black in Fashion Council’s debut showroom, he struck out on his own to start his label. “I can’t even fathom that it’s been five years since I first showed with them. What it did for my brand was transformational,” he said. “It set me on a new course and connected me to this community of creative people.” It’s wild to think how much the world has changed since then, but for Potts, his perspective on the importance of this work has not. “With the current political and cultural state, it is even more imperative for communities [like ours] to build on our own so that we are not beholden to the system,” he explained. With over 20 years as a career designer, Potts is no stranger to how the industry works, but he’s no longer interested in letting it tamper his joy: “My fall collection was a real turning point for me. With the election and all the craziness we’ve been subjected to, I knew that if I dove into my work, it would help me get out of that dark place.” That spirit is imbued into the fall collection in the form of colorful chunky knits, voluminous silhouettes, and French terry cotton covered in fun motifs. It symbolizes the shift from the surface level to something more important to him: people. “I don’t care about the clothes,” he said. “The collection is just a conduit; it’s a tool for connecting people and helping them find themselves.” “Before I understood the concept of fashion as a job, I felt like it was a way for you to bridge the gap between people’s differences. Styling, for me, has always been the simplest way to create community,” Larissa Muehleder said as we stood next to the collection she had managed to design in just 30 days. Even though Muehleder grew up in New York City, nothing made her feel “less alone” quite like creating clothing, so it’s no surprise that she was compelled to start her own bespoke label back in 2014. Although it’s been over a decade since the inception of Muehleder, there’s still a sort of childlike sparkle in her eyes that reflects her innate desire to create connection through design. The fall collection valorizes this concept by exploring the “multi-facetedness of being a woman” through pieces that can be worn various ways—such as a sharply structured cobalt blue blazer adorned with bows that can be worn as outerwear or a short dress, and an asymmetrical silk charmeuse blouse in a soft eggshell that can be styled as a bubble-hem dress or bundled around the hips as a shirt. Like the designer herself, every piece in the collection has an innate duality that reminds us that the things we think divide us can actually bring us together—if we’re willing to connect the dots. What stories get to be a part of the tapestry of America’s history? It’s not a new question by any means, but it’s something that New York–based designer Daveed Baptiste clearly thinks about a lot. Before the Haiti-born creative spent time trying to recount the tales of those who came before him through his ready-to-wear collections, Baptise’s journey began when he fell in love with fashion photography. In many ways, his passion for the glossy editorials showcased in Vogue is what sparked his desire to start his brand in 2023. “Storytelling is the thread between my photography and my design work. I’m telling stories about the Caribbean diaspora; I’m telling stories about Haitian immigrants. It’s the same story but in a different medium,” he said. It’s rare for an artist to be able to successfully work with multiple mediums—much less reflect all of the tough realities of humanity through textile manipulation—but Baptiste does so masterfully in a way that’s reminiscent of Glenn Martens and John Galliano. In particular, the most noteworthy piece from his debut collection is a light-wash distressed denim coat with a raised appliqué made from tubing that has been warped to wrap around the shoulders, bodice, and waist in a way that’s meant to mimic the migration routes used to get to the promised land. Although not a light topic to explore, a general jovial and celebratory spirit is attached to the collection through how denim dramatically drapes down the form or zippers expose an accordion of pleats. Baptiste understands that the narrative around immigration has only gotten more negative in recent months, but he gets to decide how to tell his own story with everything he creates. With so many hurdles for aspiring designers, it’s understandable that Fumi Egbon first found the idea of entering the industry intimidating. “I knew I wanted to get into fashion, but not seeing many people who look like me made me think it might not be as easy,” she said. Any initial trepidation Egbon may have had didn’t stand in her way for too long, though, as she took a leap of faith in founding her size-inclusive label amid the pandemic with no traditional fashion background to rely on. But that tenacious spirit is what has set apart her clothing from the crowd: Hand-knitted coats come with collars covered in tactile fringe; body-con knit dresses are spun from bright shades of sapphire; and the classic cropped cardigan comes alive with oversized cocoon sleeves. Her ability to take risks has paid off, as she’s shown her collection not once, but twice, at the Black in Fashion Council showroom. “I’m from Nigeria but live in Canada, so it’s harder to come by the same opportunities as American designers, but it’s great that the showroom is open to global brands. It’s allowed me to go to places that seemed unreachable before,” she said. If designer Heart Roberts looks familiar, it may be because his initial foray into fashion was as a model. Notably, his first runway show was for No Sesso’s fall 2022 collection. Although Roberts knew modeling wouldn’t be his career path forever, it was formative in unveiling his purpose: fashion design. “I didn’t realize I wanted to pursue designing until the pandemic,” he said. “At that point, I couldn’t find pants that fit my legs, so I thought, why can’t I just make them?” Soon, Roberts was spending his free time scouring bins at beloved vintage spots in Brooklyn in search of denim, fur, and other textiles to upcycle. But it wasn’t until this season’s Black in Fashion Council Showroom that Roberts finally decided to show his first collection for Hearthrob. After spending more than a year studying source materials such as the film Resident Evil and the entire Walking Dead comic series, he titled the collection Apocalypse. While the general aesthetic of the range is described by Roberts as “beautiful chaos”—think ultrabaggy jeans covered in an array of distressed denim patchwork and a white leather blazer with a hand-painted contrasting black trim—there’s a deeper linguistic and design choice happening here. “The Greek meaning of the word apocalypse is “the great unveiling,” so this is like the great unveiling of my brand,” he explained. “With this collection, I wanted to explore the consensus of these films, where people are coming together as a community to defeat things that are unnaturally against us, against things that we can’t control.” In an age when it’s easy to feel like everything is the end of the world, where we’re in constant fear over the state of our planet, it can be comforting to connect with someone just to chat about some cool upcycled jeans. It’s not revolutionary, but it gives us one more familiar face in a new world. “I think immigration leaves a sort of wounding that we don’t often think about, right?” Busayo Olupona said when reflecting on what first compelled her to return to Nigeria to reconnect with her roots. Unbeknownst to her then, those trips would be the catalyst for her leaving her career as a lawyer to focus on building her namesake label in 2012. As with her approach to law school, Olupona spent so much of those first few years studying everything she possibly could in the business. However, no amount of reading could prepare her for the challenge of having to step back from the brand for a short time because it didn’t make financial sense. “I made so many mistakes in the beginning because I was trying to figure it all out on my own,” she admitted. But she wasn’t alone forever. Things began to change for the better when she started to connect with others in the fashion community through programs such as RaiseFashion and BIFC. “That changed the trajectory of my life and the business. It’s how I got picked up by Saks and Nordstrom,” she noted. While things have been great for the brand since then, there are still moments that Olupona struggles with navigating—mainly, how to balance her label’s commerciality with artistry: “I want to make wearable things, but what’s the point of creating something that doesn’t strike any emotion or doesn’t move people? It’s a complex, delicate balance for sure.” Despite her doubts, her fall 2025 collection masterfully weaves a thread between pragmatism and idealism—most notably through tailored shirtdresses hand-dipped in bright tie-dye and woven button-down shirts meant to resemble her ancestral fabric. Whatever initial wounds Olupona may have felt about her journey as an immigrant, a designer, or a human being, those seem to be long gone now: “When I started, I knew I wanted to reconnect with Nigeria. Something in my spirit was like, You’re gonna start going back home,’ but I could have never imagined it would have brought me here.” Craftsmanship inherently requires one to commit to carrying on knowledge from the past in the hopes of creating something new in the future—that’s something that designer Durrell Dupard has conquered without fail. Originally from New Orleans, Dupard doesn’t have a technical background in fashion but was taught to sew by his grandparents. Like many designers, creating first began as a form of self-expression, but Dupard slowly started to make bespoke creations as more people approached him, asking, “Can you make those for me?” The true catalyst that led him to start his label finally came from the personal tragedy of his grandmother’s, grandfather’s, and uncle’s deaths. “After they passed, I figured it would be a good way to honor them. Instead of being sad about it, [design] was like my stress reliever. It made me feel closer to them,” he said. While Dupard doubled down on his craft by launching his label in 2020—named after his late uncle—he didn’t come around to releasing his collection until this season’s Black in Fashion Council Showroom. Much like a flower that takes time to bloom after the deadening cold of winter, the collection drew inspiration from nature in New Orleans through dimensions, textures, and colors. As Dupard elaborates: “The collection is called Magnolia Muse, which is our state’s flower. I love nature; I wouldn’t say I grew up in the country, because it’s Louisiana, but I was drawing from the landscape.” The references are reflected the most in a single piece, the one that Dupard says is the embodiment of his creative journey: An androgynous leather puffer jacket is covered in a Technicolor floral print with clear drops on the outside meant to resemble all of the “rainy” periods in his life that led him to grow. “I think all forms of artistic impression, be it music, books, fashion, or sculpture, are stories of our time,” Rene Moshi Macdonald said emphatically, even though it must have felt like midnight for her as she grappled with jet lag. It seemed time was one of the most imperative parts of Macdonald’s story, as she didn’t set out to start her business, Lisou, until her late 40s, when her children had left the nest. “As they got older, they were the ones who encouraged me to start my brand. They said, ‘You’ve given us all this time, and now is your time.’” Macdonald may have gotten the initial blessing from her children to start her business—something that continues to this day, as her son was able to show up for her at the Black in Fashion Council Showroom while she was traveling through Thailand—but pivoting from her academic background as a professor at London University wasn’t as effortless. “I’m kind of the typical African girl, in the sense that, if I had told my dad, ‘I want to study fashion,’ he would have been like, ‘That’s a hobby,’” she said. It’s easy to glean that Macdonald’s early life was shaped by the fact her parents sacrificed so much to send her to boarding school as they worked for the United Nations, so it wasn’t until the right time in her life appeared that she felt free to explore her love for fashion. That feeling of liberation is embedded in every aspect of her work, especially in her ability to transform timeless silhouettes through Technicolor prints that she created herself. Possibly one of the best examples of how she’s able to use her academic background to inform her design aesthetic is the fall 2025 print she’s coined Afrocamo. Her son helped her print out every country on the continent of Africa, arranging them into a camolike print. “I wanted to do a collection about colonialism, which is why it’s called Empire, weaving the words we cannot speak, which sort of seems pertinent to the moment we currently find ourselves in,” she explained. Although the collection’s print centers on a serious topic, like all of Macdonald’s work, bright color palettes and portions make the pieces more approachable for wider audiences. Of course, she doesn’t necessarily design with the idea of reaching a specific consumer; rather, her approach is about unearthing the story that defines why she designs: “I spent so much time thinking about what my purpose was with Lisou, and then I came into the studio one day and my team had put these words on the wall that I used to say all the time: ‘Joy is our purpose.’” Community has become a word often thrown around as a marketing ploy, but for Shareef Mosby and Jon Cope, it’s central to everything they create. It was sort of fated that the head designer (Mosby) and fashion communication director (Cope) met many years ago: Both had familial ties to Richmond, Virginia, but didn’t cross paths until they randomly moved into the same apartment building over 15 years ago. One of the first signs that they’d work well together is how they instantly saw each other from the start; so rarely are we in community with someone by simply letting them be themselves. “I think that is what it’s about at the core of fashion. It’s about asking yourself, How can I find a way to vibe with this person who may be so different from me? Because, me and Shareef? I’m queer, and he’s straight, but he’s like my family; he listens to me and values what I have to say,” Cope said. Even as a bystander, it’s nearly impossible not to feel the admiration that these two have for each other; it’s affirmed by tiny little interactions, as when Mosby shared his nickname for Cope. “I call him V, because when I met him, he had all of these old copies of Vogue; he’s a voracious reader,” said Mosby. For both creatives, being able to honor each other’s differences has allowed them to explore parts of themselves that might be “uncomfortable” through the collections they create, which manifests as tailored staples with dark twists (e.g., a white deconstructed button-down shirt covered in grommets or sleek crescent bags covered in studs). “Designing is about being vulnerable; it’s about allowing ourselves to tap into our shadow sides, which is why we named the brand Victim15. We’re in this space of redefining what victim means and learning how to integrate that into our lives in a way that won’t bring us down but empower us,” Cope said. The symbiotic relationship between the two has allowed them to scale the brand in ways they could have never imagined, such as being able to financially support a creative team, showing their collection for the first time at the Black in Fashion Council Showroom, and, more recently, moving to Los Angeles to start a new chapter. When probed about their hopes for the brand’s future, Mosby admitted, “I’m trying to go on this journey without having too many huge expectations. But I think we’re finally coming into this space of being in community with everything around us; we’re exactly where we’re supposed to be.” Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

Working 9-to-5! Stars Are Showing How Winter Suits Are Done,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/winter-suits-2025-celebrity-trend-red-carpet,"February 13, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"A-list celebrities are hardly commuting to corporate 9-to-5 desk jobs every day—yet judging by their sleek array of winter suits, you could certainly assume that was the case. These past few months, well-clad stars such as Kendall Jenner, Rihanna, and Hailey Bieber have been spotted in classic two-pieces (whether skirt suits or pant versions) that could command any boardroom or high-up executive meeting. Though, office dressing is not the intention of their polished looks at all: With modern updates and cool accessories, their suiting moments are more so built for a day off—or for a fun night out. At first glance, the suits themselves are quite traditional. But how they've been styled makes all the difference. Take Rihanna, who elevated her gray blazer and trousers with the addition of an Hermès scarf tied around her neck, like a tie. On her feet, her patent Margiela Tabi heels lent a more progressive feel as well. Hailey Bieber, meanwhile, slipped into a vintage Mugler pinstriped skirt suit—but her sheer tights, pointed pumps, and itty-bitty shades made it all feel very 2025. Modernized silhouettes and hues also made the winter suits feel of-the-moment. In Saint Laurent, Nicole Kidman turned heads at the Critics Choice Awards in an oversized suit with pleated high-waisted pants. At the DGA Awards, Elle Fanning went streamlined in a new-Valentino suit, and the champagne-colored satin lapels and bowed cummerbund were perfect for evening. The 2025 approach to winter suits? It’s all about taking your timeless two-piece and giving it slight twist. Kind of like what your cool boss would wear to work. Below, more standout suit moments from winter 2025.

New York Fashion Week Street Style Embraced a Ladylike Agenda—7 Outfits to Re-create,https://www.vogue.com/article/new-york-fashion-week-looks-fw25,"February 13, 2025",By Cortne Bonilla,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. The fall 2025 New York Fashion Week shows have officially ended, and the city-dwelling street style scene is always one to watch. I mean, who does New York better than New Yorkers? Amid what felt like an eternity of larger-than-life silhouettes, it seems a new sartorial tide has turned. While you’ll never not see oversized shapes and head-to-boot monochromatic looks, a demure and sophisticated approach dominated the streets of Manhattan and Brooklyn: ladylike dressing. Structured jackets (some collarless, some cinched at the waist) first arrived on the scene last spring, and now we’re seeing these feminine sensibilities influence other categories. Showgoers embraced the modern lady, taking cues from the past with long leather gloves peeking out from elegant outerwear or affixed onto belts, brooches pinned to jacket lapels, and an array of silk scarves to add a burst of color and lightweight warmth (it’s still winter!). For an easy transition into the new season, there are a plethora of ladylike goodies—and styling tips—to take from the NYFW scene. From fitted coats and classic blazers to leather gloves, skinny belts, and more, here are our favorite street style looks to re-create from the uptown-meets-downtown-meets-Brooklyn crowd. Just when you think New York couldn’t get any gloomier, an eruption of vivid color emerges onto the scene.

"For Anya Taylor-Joy and Sabrina Carpenter, Diamonds Are a Back’s Best Friend",https://www.vogue.com/article/backward-necklace-trend-anya-taylor-joy-sabrina-carpenter-taylor-russell,"February 13, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Nowadays, celebrities are taking a subtler approach to their jewelry, flipping their necklaces around. Call it business in the front, diamonds in the back. Last night, Anya Taylor-Joy attended the premiere of her film The Gorge in a strapless white Dior minidress with a pleated capelet that fanned out like wings. She accessorized her avian dress with a platinum and diamond Tiffany & Co. Archives necklace, which she wore backward so that it sat atop her collarbone and draped delicately down her back. Taylor-Joy hasn’t been alone in rocking the backward necklace recently. Sabrina Carpenter walked the red carpet at the 2025 Grammys in a baby blue JW Anderson dress festooned with ostrich feathers. Instead of a traditional halter, a 50-carat brilliant-cut diamond necklace from Chopard stood in for the neckline, seemingly connected to the dress itself. Ever the fan of an Old Hollywood reference, Carpenter’s look nodded to Shirley MacLaine’s character Louisa May Foster in the 1964 film What a Way to Go! The backward trend picked up some steam at the 2024 Venice Film Festival when Taylor Russell gave the look a try. Whereas Taylor-Joy and Carpenter both opted for jewelry that draped down their back, Russell wore a shorter Tiffany & Co. necklace (with an 11-carat pear-cut diamond pendant) which sat just below the base of her neck, serving as the perfect compliment to her white dress, accessorized with a gauzy scarf. So next time you wear a top or dress with a low back, consider turning your jewelry around to add a sparkly surprise. Taylor Russell at the 2024 Venice Film Festival.

Jennifer Lawrence Adds a Modern Classic to Her Maternity Wardrobe,https://www.vogue.com/article/jennifer-lawrence-leopard-coat-winter-trend,"February 13, 2025",By Olivia Allen,"Somehow, it’s still coat season. Dressing for warmth and style is no mean feat, as all those who navigated freezing temperatures and sleet-soaked streets at New York Fashion Week will know, but Jennifer Lawrence, for one, has cracked the code. The actor, who is expecting her second child, stepped out in a leopard-print coat from By Malene Birger that channels ’60s mod energy with a 2025 flair. Considered a neutral by those in the know, a leopard coat is the ultimate winter wardrobe staple. J Law paired hers with The Row’s ludicrously capacious Park Tote and a pair of oversized tortoiseshell sunglasses: a masterclass in incognito chic. A fashion week favorite, the leopard-print coat has made a roaring comeback, this time in iterations that feel more timeless than trend-driven (lest we forget the 2014 Topshop coat that did the rounds). Gone are the fast-fashion versions of the past, this season’s take is all about refined silhouettes and grown-up fabrics. So, while a New York winter may be relentless, Jennifer proves that a statement coat is all you need to keep things fun when it’s freezing. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

Dua Lipa Is the Final Boss of This It Girl Coat,https://www.vogue.com/article/dua-lipa-penny-lane-coat,"February 13, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Penny Lane has the girls in a chokehold. From Bella Hadid to Taylor Swift and now, Dua Lipa. The fuzzy-trimmed collar coat, with its nipped in waist, harkens back to the 2000 cult classic film Almost Famous and its alluring character Penny Lane. The groupie and ‘band aid,’ played by Kate Hudson, has an enviable Afghan coat. Big collar, big personality. It’s become an it girl calling card this winter; Dua Lipa is the next to bundle up and ensconce herself in shearling. The musician opted for a shearling collar leather coat in a buttery burgundy leather from Bottega Veneta, paired with black trousers, snake print pointy boots, and a quilted Chanel bag (as the newly minted Chanel ambassador can). Plus, that headline-catching ring. While the rest of her outfit is slim and close-fitting, the plush and full-bodied coat collar is gargantuan—perfect for the London chill, and a quick escape into the night with partner Callum Turner. Lipa and Turner had been out on a date night, and were photographed leaving Chiltern Firehouse in the early hours of the morning. The shaggy-trimmed coat-of-the-moment has been having somewhat of a resurgence as a chic and functional piece of outerwear. Taylor Swift remains a devotee to British label Charlotte Simone’s faux-fur creations in pleasing cherry red tones and more classic styles, while Bella Hadid often mines the archive for vintage iterations by way of Dolce & Gabbana, giving them her own contemporary western core twist. Lipa’s winter wardrobe has been percolating with strong outwear and accessories—a bold snakeskin coat by Jil Sander, a plushy puffer jacket and a heavily charmed Hermès Birkin. Date night always requires a strong look—Turner and Lipa’s jaunt to Paris amid Couture Week was a sight to behold, with big bows and bigger, romantic restaurant bookings. Lipa is soon to jet off once again for the next leg of her Radical Optimism tour, which kicks off in Australia and New Zealand in March, travelling back to Europe and then to North America. The cozy coats will stay at home when she absconds to Oz, but now we’ve got Lipa’s summer wardrobe, bursting with bikinis and diaphanous beach dresses, to anticipate.

8 New York Fashion Week Moments You May Have Missed,https://www.vogue.com/article/8-new-york-fashion-week-moments-you-may-have-missed,"February 12, 2025",By Kelsey Stiegman,"“This and yap,” was the unofficial catchphrase of New York Fashion Week’s fall 2025 season. It captioned countless editor Instagram Stories and grid posts, often accompanied by a $25 bowl of pasta and a brimming martini (the standard fashion week fuel). For regular attendees, the biannual event is a time for market research and content creation—yes—but, most importantly, it’s a time to kiki. Though both garments and the designers who make them change with each season, one thing can always be counted on: the whispered commentary between seasoned editors as the runway music blares—and if not there, then in the backs of Lyfts, over cups of coffee, or via cleverly-named group chats. Though anyone can consume watered-down fashion week highlights through the second-hand perspective of a phone screen, it’s these private conversations between show-goers that truly speak to a collection’s success (or lack thereof). With New York City working hard to reclaim its title as a fashion capital of the world, this NYFW season provided plenty of off-the-cuff moments to inspire these exchanges. From sartorial seances and PETA protesters to celebrity run-ins, revisit the moments that had editors talking. Zoe Gustavia Anna Whalen fall 2025 On Feb. 10, designer Zoe Gustavia Anna Whalen hosted her first runway show on the CFDA calendar—“runway show” being a loose term. The candle-lit ceremony was more like a summoning circle than the traditional catwalk one would expect. Invited guests sat around a shadowy stage (on the wood floor, in some cases), observing models as they placed offerings on a center altar. Though the candles created ambience, some audience members were concerned for fire safety. It was certainly a memorable choice, given that fashion week has seen many an after-party shut down by the New York City fire marshals. Lisa Rinna closing Jane Wade fall 2025. The Real Housewives hive has been eating well this season, with cast members abandoning their respective cities for New York City’s fashion escapades. Events were so well-attended—with Luann de Lesseps, Dorinda Medley, Jenna Lyons, and Bronwyn Newport all making appearances—that one PR rep affectionately dubbed the week “Bravocon.” Even with the reality TV stars checking in at nearly every event, none incited a bigger frenzy than Lisa Rinna, who made a surprise performance at Jane Wade. Rinna played the part of the no-bullshit CEO, eliciting audible gasps from the crowd and closing the office-themed fashion show with a bang. As sure as fashion month is long, Coach’s show will inevitably be disrupted by protesters. Animal cruelty activists have started a tradition of sorts, habitually disrupting the label’s shows season after season after season. Security dragged one catwalk crasher out of the venue, down the front steps, and onto the curb like last night’s recycling. The protester continued to scream “leather kills” at the top of their lungs while being used as a human dust mop (the footage of which promptly made the rounds). After six days of nonstop clothing, the interruption actually energized weary show-goers, with some calling it a “highlight” of the week. Colleen Allen fall 2025 Colleen Allen fall 2025 In terms of memorability, the fresh-on-the-scene designer’s NYFW presentation rivaled household names. Allen opted out of the fashion show spectacle, instead hosting intimate appointments with a select few to show off her creations. Even without the theatrics of a choreographed runway, she was still able to make an impression on the minds and social media accounts of the industry insiders who viewed her work. Within hours, fashion-adjacent feeds were awash with the frilly bloomers and cerulean velvet coat she showed in her fall 2025 collection—the likes of which will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the most photographed pieces of the week. Kendall Jenner walking for Calvin Klein Collection fall 2025. Bad Bunny sitting front row at Calvin Klein Collection fall 2025. The reality TV star-turned-supermodel walked in Veronica Leoni’s first show for Calvin Klein Collection (and the brand’s first since 2017). Though Jenner was impeccably dressed in an outsized topcoat, it wasn’t her garb that had Slack channels buzzing, but her audience. Jenner walked the CK runway with ex-boyfriend Bad Bunny sitting front row. The question on editors’ lips and group chats was: Are they back together? Luar fall 2025 Patricio Campillo Brooklyn-based designer Raul Lopez used a homophobic slur as the inspiration for his upcoming line, reclaiming the term “el pato.” While his flamboyantly feathered accessories were a hit, a black T-shirt also got the message across: “I talk shit about you in Spanish.” Meanwhile, Patricio Campillo’s stage fell in line with the omnipresent workwear aesthetic—up until the creative director’s customary post-show appearance. He himself sported a tee that read “El Golfo de México,” a push-back against President Trump’s attempt to rename the body of water. Collina Strada fall 2025. Though Wiederhoeft was noticeably absent from this season’s lineup, Collina Strada stepped up to the plate, providing NYFW with some much-needed representation for the quirky bride community. Known for its emphasis on environmental responsibility, the cult-favorite brand employed a no-waste strategy, transforming vintage wedding dresses into, as founder Hillary Taymour wrote in her show notes, “modern Collina couture.” To present her secondhand confections, Taymour sent dual brides, turning the catwalk into a makeshift wedding aisle where the two shared a kiss, sealing their bond in holy sartorial matrimony. Delighted cheers from the audience continued until the show closed with a remix of “Cheetah Sisters” by the Cheetah Girls. Khaite fall 2025 Altuzarra fall 2025 Theophilio fall 2025 Khaite used their Feb. 8 runway as an opportunity to move away from their trademark bubble stud—a design detail that has defined their product offerings for years. Instead of merchandising outfits with Elena bags or Benny belts, the label embraced a different accessory, using ’30s-era ascot caps to accent more than a dozen looks. Altuzarra and Theophilio, on the other hand, utilized an even more obscure category of headwear. The former topped models with braided wool caps and embellished net styles, while the latter chose pillowy Renaissance-reminiscent landsknecht hats in animal prints and tartan plaid.

What Is the Difference Between Bootcut and Flare Jeans?,https://www.vogue.com/article/bootcut-jeans-vs-flare-jeans,"February 12, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"When Kendrick Lamar hit the stage at the Super Bowl Halftime Show, we had many pressing questions: What does his “a” necklace stand for? Would he perform “Not Like Us?” And most urgently, Where did he get those jeans? All questions were soon answered (the logo for Lamar’s communication company pgLang, but it served as a nice double entendre for his lyric “a minoooor”; yes and he called Drake out by name; Celine). But Lamar’s statement pants opened the gates to a new quandary: were they bootcut jeans or flares? The question made me pause. Are flares bootcuts like a square is a rectangle? Kind of. Flares seem more clear-cut: hip- and thigh-hugging pants that dramatically kick out at the knee. Another noted fan of the look is Pharrell Williams, whose proclivity for the retro pants has made its way into his Louis Vuitton menswear. Pharrell Williams in flare jeans. Bootcut jeans, however, seem to have some more leeway. They adopt a more straight-legged silhouette with a less exaggerated flare below the knee. Rather, they’re meant to accommodate a boot, not make a disco-inspired statement. While they can lean more bodycon, bootcut can also adopt a baggy form. Beloved by naughties royalty Beyoncé and Jennifer Aniston, they’ve found a new life in the 2020s, namely on models like Bella Hadid. (Given Hadid’s rodeo activities, it only makes sense she’d be into them.) While people remain divided, Celine weighed into the debate, categorizing Kendrick Lamar’s light-wash denim as flares. So at least one case is settled. Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

The Best Front Row Style From New York Fashion Week,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/new-york-fashion-week-front-row-celebrities-fall-2025,"February 12, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Brace yourselves! Another New York Fashion Week has officially arrived, and the new fall 2025 collections are sure to delight all fashion spectators. The official calendar features many exciting shows to look forward to: Christopher John Rogers! Luar! Tory Burch!—all guaranteed to have front rows filled with A-list celebrities. The always-buzzy Marc Jacobs show kicked off NYFW with a bang. Celebrities such as Tracee Ellis Ross, Lisa Rinna, and Nara Smith all leaned into the designer’s signature cartoony silhouettes, bravely rocking exaggerated coats and extra-clunky shoes with pride. At Lingua Franca’s first-ever show, Katie Couric and Devon Walker were among those sitting front row, while Molly Ringwald, Jenna Lyons, and more made surprises cameos on the runway.

This Is Kate Middleton’s Hardest Working Coat—and It’s Bespoke,https://www.vogue.com/article/kate-middleton-princess-of-wales-bespoke-coat,"February 12, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"While the palace is supposedly moving away from reporting on Kate Middleton’s wardrobe, royal fans won’t have to dig too deep to get the details on the Princess of Wale’s current fashion. Yes, it’s another rewear. Catherine Princess of Wales made an appearance yesterday at a mother and baby unit at HMP Styal in Cheshire, England, where she met incarcerated women, staff, and advocates. The royal spoke with both formerly incarcerated women and those still in prison who access help from the charity Action for Children, where she is a royal patron. She wore a bespoke burgundy windowpane check Blaze Milano coat (which had been lengthened for the princess), a Gabriela Hearst turtleneck sweater, an Edeline Lee skirt, and brown pointed boots. Most recently, she wore this same, typical and elegant outfit to visit The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust—of which she and husband Prince William had been made patrons—where she met medical staff and patients. It was one of her first official royal appearances, marking a tentative return to duties now she is in remission from cancer. Kate also wore the coat back in December 2021 for Christmas Day mass. Kate Middleton on a previous visit to The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust Kate Middleton has long been hailed the queen of coats, with outerwear being the style staple she returns to again and again. As well as this Blaze Milano coat, she often sports designs from London labels like Alexander McQueen and Catherine Walker. She is a devoted fan to tailoring, wearing double-breasted coats and more structured tuxedo styles for evening events. And of course, she’s dedicated to making the most out of what’s currently hanging in her closet, like the sensible houndstooth Zara dress that made another appearance last month. As reported by The Sunday Times, Kensington Palace says it will no longer share details on what the royal wears to official appearances. “She wants the focus to be on the really important issues, the people and the causes she is spotlighting,” a palace source told the paper. “There will always be an appreciation of what the princess is wearing from some of the public and she gets that. But do we need to be officially always saying what she is wearing? No.” A palace spokesperson has since refuted that. “Over the last week, I have received numerous questions about a story regarding The Princess of Wales’s clothing and how Kensington Palace shares information about her outfits,” said a statement from a palace representative. “To clarify, the comments that appeared in the article were from me, not The Princess of Wales.” “The comments that were reported should not be directly attributed to The Princess of Wales,” the statement continued. “To be clear, there has been no change in our approach to sharing information about Her Royal Highness’s clothing.” Whatever the case, Kate’s focus on mindful dressing means we won’t have to ponder too long.

Timothée Chalamet Wears Florals With a Twist for Date Night,https://www.vogue.com/article/timothee-chalamet-floral-shirt-date-night,"February 12, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Florals, for Valentine’s? Not very groundbreaking, but when it’s a Prada bouquet print in highlighter green on Timothée Chalamet? Romance! Yesterday (February 11), Chalamet attended the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, where he was being honored with the Arlington Artist Of The Year Award for his roles in A Complete Unknown and Dune: Part Two. Girlfriend Kylie Jenner was present to support, making the evening into a date night for the pair. Chalamet’s cotton shirt features a lively floral scene in lime green, yellow and white, taken from Prada’s archive of prints, with tapered cuffs and a collar, finished with mother of pearl buttons. Styled by Taylor McNeill, Chalamet wore a grass green tank top underneath, a silver chain, loose faded denim jeans (forgoing the bootcut shape originally meant for him, that McNeill put on Kendrick Lamar for his Super Bowl performance), and his favorite white sneakers. The mustache, too, lives on, and he’s trimmed his hair into more of a pixie cut. Chalamet also took to the stage for a conversation with Dune co-star Josh Brolin. Date night style varies for Chalamet and Jenner, following more their own individual style codes rather than the sartorial contours of their respective partner. When they were photographed out for dinner in Paris, Chalamet wore Chanel fresh from the A Complete Unknown premiere. His current wardrobe consists of Martine Rose and an array of small New York designers in a nod to his home city. Jenner opts for her own label KHY, Chanel tweed, and bombshell silhouettes. Timothée Chalamet’s awards campaign wardrobe has been somewhat chaotic, cycling through Bob Dylan method dressing, smart vintage picks, and pal Haider Ackermann’s iteration of Celine—with a continued allegiance to the skinny scarf trend. This romantic Prada feels, at least, on theme. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

A Moment For the Cool Model-Off-Duty Looks From NYFW,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/best-model-off-duty-looks-nyfw-fall-2025,"February 11, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"The new fall 2025 collections, debuted during New York Fashion Week, were not the only exciting looks to take in this week. Off the catwalk, the street style scene put forward interesting new outfit propositions as well—be it via great coats, new It bags, or statement hosiery. And while this season’s crop of well-clad showgoers mostly consisted of celebrities, editors, and VIP influencers, the participating models—dashing from one show to the next—also delivered their own fashion flavor. This week’s shows served as a true hub for impeccable model-off-duty style, as there is something effortlessly cool about the way models put outfits together in between gigs. Sure, their own outfits often different drastically from the new designs they sport on the runway, but they sometimes strike similar notes of elegance and trendiness. Take model of the moment Alex Consani, who was spotted in an oversized cream sweater and slouchy leather boots, or runway regular Paloma Elsesser, who paired calf-length leggings with a cropped leather bomber. Other supermodels, like Kendall Jenner, opted for statement accessories to keep warm during the week—like a jaunty hat and scarf. While the looks were built for function and coziness while on-the-go—they were also perfect for the awaiting street style photographers crowing around pre-and-post show. This is NYFW, after all: one must be camera-ready at all times. In need of some winter style inspiration? Look no further than to the models who made the streets of New York their personal runway. Below, more of the best model-off-duty moments from NYFW. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Havana Rose Liu and Kristine Froseth Have a Girls’ Night Out at the Tory Burch Show,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/havana-rose-liu-kristine-froseth-girls-night-out-tory-burch-show,"February 11, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Not every girls’ night out ends at the Tory Burch show. But when Havana Rose Liu and Kristine Froseth left rehearsals for their forthcoming Off-Broadway show All Nighter, they headed straight to glam—in matching Tory Burch tracksuits, of course—before dashing to the designer’s fall 2025 runway at the Museum of Modern Art. Below, Liu and Froseth bring us along as they bop between rehearsal and the runway—and let us in on their night-out rituals. (Hint: They’re just as obsessed with Doechii as we are.) Havana Rose Liu and Kristine Froseth at Tory Burch fall 2025 at MoMA. Vogue: What’s your pump-up ritual for a girls’ night out? Havana Rose Liu: Music, music, music! Trying on a lot of different outfits that I will have to tidy up later (bummer), dancing around until I’m going to be late, and then more music on the train or in the car! Kristine Froseth: I always blast my getting ready playlist which includes a lot of Jamie xx and Doechii; I boogie while I pick out my outfit (mood dependent) and do glam (glitter is usually applied). What do you two like to do together most? KF: We looove to dance! We met at an event and had barely spoken, but immediately connected on the dance floor. Havana’s energy is so alive and contagious; I always feel like I’m laughing or dancing with her in the most expressive ways! HRL: Kristine you little dream! I feel the same way—Kristine is so bright and free! It’s true, we have danced together a lot, and sort of in an unhinged way every time…I think we bring out a lot of good silliness in each other. What drew you to your outfits tonight? KF: I fell in LOVE with the black dress the moment I saw it because of its elegance and darkness. I love playing with oppositions and the dress made me tap into both my dark and feminine side. I felt empowered and honest. HRL: We were going to match, and I was going to wear the dress in white—but then I swooned over these pants! I couldn’t help it, they were singing to me from the rack. The texture, the construction—they are such powerful pants. I feel ferocious in them. Sadly, I don’t think I’m actually that ferocious in real life; it’s a ruse. So, I had to wear my amazing pants and abandon Kristine, but it’s okay because Kristine looks so amazing. How does your look tonight reflect your personal style? HRL: This look is outside my comfort zone in a way I really enjoy. I love that a good outfit can let you take a step outside of yourself. Although, I will say, in real life, I do prioritize good, interesting pants and things I can move in, and this look holds both! In terms of personal style, I feel like I have always appreciated that clothes can be used to reflect my internal world in a way that’s vulnerable and thoughtful, but recently I’ve been seeing clothes as a gateway to adventure. KF: I am quite pragmatic when it comes to clothing while also being very true to my current emotional self. I have a lot of fun expressing what I am currently feeling or going through with fashion, so it ebbs and flows, but I always make sure to feel comfortable. This dress is incredibly comfortable (!!) and allowed me to express both my power and sadness. Without feeling like I can move how I need/want, I can’t be true to the moment. It all began on the dance floor one night... and now here we are rehearsing our first play (YES GO GET YOUR TICKETS!) —Kristine WEEK 2 OF REHEARSALS... is giving us life, love and chaos... now please join us as we venture into the world of Tory. — Kristine And yes, a Tory Burch shopping bag makes the perfect rehearsal companion. — Havana OTW WE GO and of course, whenever we get the chance to dance, we do! — Kristine There’s never a moment where we aren’t giggling and laughing together.

Lisa Perfects the Red Carpet Transformation—From Princess to Bombshell,https://www.vogue.com/article/lisa-polar-opposite-looks-white-lotus-premiere,"February 11, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"It’s time to check into the White Lotus—meaning, season three of the hit HBO series from Mike White is finally here. Premiering on Sunday night, this season is set at a ritzy resort in Thailand, and features an ensemble cast including Parker Posey, Lisa, Leslie Bibb, Natasha Rothwell, Carrie Coon, and many more. Last night, the show celebrated its premiere in Los Angeles, and the whole A-list crew turned out for the affair. And no, they weren’t in the easy-breezy vacation wear that their characters don in the series: they brought their finest formalwear to the event instead. Naturally, Lisa, a red carpet star in her own right, was a standout VIP guest. The actor and K-pop star not only brought one striking gown to the premiere, she brought two—and the designs were the polar-opposite of each other. Lisa’s first red carpet dress was fit for a princess: She donned an ethereal Miss Sohee Couture gown in shades of white and yellow. The design featured a fitted bodice embroidered with pearls, mother of pearl, and crystals cascading down into a flowy silk-chiffon skirt. The superstar’s after-party look, however, leaned way more bombshell. Changing it up, Lisa slipped into a black and white Schiaparelli gown that featured a mesh cutout torso and draped skirt. The slinky and skin-revealing silhouette, from the label’s fall 2024 collection, lent itself perfectly for celebrating and dancing the night away. Did you really think a fashion plate such as Lisa was only going to turn one head-turning look for her big premiere night? Here is to hoping that she has many more red carpet premieres to come—we want more! More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

"Move Over, Margaux—The Row India Bag Is Coming for the Throne",https://www.vogue.com/article/the-row-india-bag,"February 11, 2025",By Cortne Bonilla,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. When does a handbag evolve into more than a handbag? Well, when that handbag ignites the embers of sartorial sensibilities across the fashion sphere. The slouchy shape of The Row’s Margaux bag is instantly recognizable and wildly, unapologetically duplicated—and although it was meant to be the luminous signal of “quiet luxury,” its power is actually quite loud. It should come as little surprise, then, that whatever spell Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen cast onto their coveted designs has boiled over onto yet another bag from the brand. The Row India bag is here, and its presence doesn’t need to burst into the room to be acknowledged. The best way to describe the bag is by characterizing your quick-witted, polished, and Post-it-note-loving older sister. She (yes, it’s a she) has the same energy as a high-functioning, independent woman—with little to fuss over or to waste. More than likely, her calendar is consolidated and color-coordinated. Made in Italy, the India is an updated bowling bag with a spacious interior, roll-top handles, and an exterior padlock hardware detail that comes in The Row’s version of a rainbow with chestnut, camel, black, ivory, and a daring deep blue called Blue Nights. The sizes range from India 10 to India 12 to India 15.75. Unfortunately for your pocket, the prices range from $3,850 to $5,450, similar to the Margaux’s (but hey, at least this one is well stocked—for now!). Unlike the Margaux, you won’t find any effortless slouch here. Instead, the India wants you to convey the art of looking effort-full. She has structure, form, and body. She screams, “Strive and endeavor!” This New York Fashion Week it became clear, thanks to the countless street-style sightings IRL of stylish showgoers, that the India bag is the next chess move in The Row’s global supremacy. And while the structured silhouette boasts the utmost levels of refinement and grace, the style looks good on pretty much everybody and fits everything a gal could need in a day, be it a small army of lipsticks and lotions, a laptop, a leather-bound notebook, a change of clothes—and that’s just what The Row does best.

Will Men Buy Bootcut Jeans After Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl Performance?,https://www.vogue.com/article/will-men-buy-bootcut-jeans-kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-performance,"February 11, 2025",By Maliha Shoaib,"Kendrick Lamar’s bootcut Celine jeans were arguably the star of his Super Bowl half-time performance. It’s not just Lamar, though: bootcut jeans were seen across a few runway shows for fall 2025 and spring 2025, including at Louis Vuitton (creative director Pharrell Williams himself is a bootcut aficionado) and Amiri. Will men start buying in? It’s a polarising trend, says Zak Maoui, style director at the Gentleman’s Journal and former style editor at GQ. “I’ve only seen positive things about Kendrick Lamar’s instantly viral bootcut jeans from Celine, with people begging to know where they were from—but last week, X was full of people dissing Pharrell’s bootcuts,” he says. It raises the question: is a viral moment from the right celeb enough to spark a revolution in men’s style? “What’s interesting is that after several years of flared jeans and trousers surging among vintage menswear enthusiasts emulating Bob Dylan and Serge Gainsbourg, figures like Kendrick and Pharrell have been recently making flares look contemporary rather than retro,” says Samuel Hine, senior fashion writer at GQ, adding that, inspired by Lamar, he just dug an old pair of Celine flares out of his closet. Amiri spring 2025 menswear and Louis Vuitton menswear spring 2025. Jeans and trouser silhouettes are ever-evolving. While baggier shapes have dominated the past five years, trend analysts say we’re likely to see the pendulum swing back. In womenswear, we’re already seeing a shift towards slimmer trouser silhouettes, which started during the fall 2024 shows and has been brought into the mainstream by TikTok creator Alix Earle. The Gen Z star released a pair of skinny jeans in January in collaboration with Frame, prompting a viral TikTok trend where users have been showing off how they’re styling the silhouette for 2025. Analytics platform Heuritech predicts sales of wide-leg jeans to decline 3% over the next year, while slim and straight-leg jeans are expected to grow 2% and 4%, respectively. “This shift illustrates the influence of quiet luxury, with its emphasis on more tailored, refined shapes, now making its mark on streetwear and casualwear as well,” says Heuritech fashion analyst Frida Tordhag. Hedi Slimane, who was creative director of Celine until October, was the force behind the popularisation of skinny jeans for men, which he introduced at both YSL and Dior Men. “Celine—whose jeans Lamar is wearing—has been pushing this skinny-ish to mid-flare hybrid for a bit,” says Vogue Runway’s Luke Leitch. In some ways, bootcut is a middle ground between baggy and skinny jeans. “We’ve seen male shoppers embracing baggier styles and this feels like a natural evolution, with multiple ways to style and wear,” says Katy Lubin, VP of brand and communications at Lyst. Searches for men’s flared and bootcut jeans have increased 12% on the fashion search platform over the past three months. Yet, bootcut still feels like a more daunting silhouette than slim or baggy to the average man—like GQ’s Hine says, bootcut is often associated with a more fashion-forward retro look. “The bootcut or flare jeans trend definitely has the potential to take off commercially in menswear, but it will likely follow a gradual adoption rather than an overnight explosion,” agrees buying consultant Natasha Advani, who is former head of menswear buying at Selfridges and founder of Not/Applicable Vintage. “While high fashion and influential artists like Pharrell and Kendrick are already embracing flared silhouettes, mainstream menswear tends to take longer to shift, especially when moving away from the dominant baggy, straight-leg cuts that have been popular for years. If major denim labels and retailers introduce more subtle bootcut variations before going fully flared, it could ease the transition for mass-market consumers.” Pharrell Williams is often seen wearing bootcut jeans. In this sense, flares may give way for a slimmer silhouette in general. “Just as wide-leg shapes caused straight fit to overtake slim as the top invested denim shape, this season, flares could cause a switch back to slimmer-fitting jeans in 2025,” says Karis Munday, menswear analyst at retail intelligence firm EDITED. According to EDITED research, baggy jeans are still on the up (rising 27% year-on-year)—but growth is slowing considerably. The previous year, baggy jeans were up 150% in menswear. Munday says she has noticed “an uptick in slimmer shapes on the fall 2025 runway.” This all has an impact on footwear choices too, adds Leitch. The genuine impact of a viral trend can differ in menswear compared to womenswear. “Menswear, in contrast to womenswear, has traditionally been less influenced by viral internet moments,” says Heuritech’s Tordhag. “While trends in menswear don’t necessarily take longer to develop, there has historically been less interest in following the rapid shifts in aesthetics and trends that often dominate the fashion world.” Nevertheless, men are “just as bombarded” by shopping inspiration as female consumers, says Lubin, so it can differ depending on the segment of male consumer. “There are clusters of menswear shoppers who are highly influenced by new drops from brands they love—whether that’s brands in the sportswear, contemporary or luxury space,” she says. “A viral moment for these shoppers isn’t necessarily driven by a global mega-celebrity, it could be more about the community of shoppers and tastemakers surrounding that brand all posting about or wearing a new product.” There are some figures who are more prominent tastemakers than others, Lamar being one of them. “Certain celebrities create viral moments just about any time they step outside wearing something unexpected. Kendrick is one of those people—he and his stylist Taylor McNeill know how to use clothing to stir conversation,” says Hine. “I do think these viral moments have an impact because a huge audience of men are seeing Kendrick—a superstar who embodies a very modern sense of masculinity—trying something out of the ordinary, which gives them license to do the same. That said, menswear tends to move slowly. It’s still a relatively niche style.” Trend analysts agree. Tordhag expects the trend to “hold some appeal, but be less popular in the border mass-market segment”. Heuritech data shows that flare trousers will see 2% growth in Europe during Q3 2025, compared with the year prior, but will decrease by 7% throughout the remainder of the year. Flared tailoring options have become more popular as male celebrities experiment with their red carpet looks. Pictured above, Harris Dickinson wears a Tiger of Sweden suit at the GQ Men of the Year Awards in November 2024. Nevertheless, the relative accessibility of bootcut jeans makes it easy to experiment, particularly with secondhand styles. “I think if a viral moment is centered around a look or an item of clothing that is easily accessible to the public, then it will more likely result in an uptick in sales and virality of said product, and not just the social media virality of an image of a celebrity wearing it,” says Maoui. All in all, the trend is likely to be reserved for a more fashion-savvy menswear shopper. “Like with most fashion trends that lean a little into the left field, I think there will be space for them in certain major cities—London, New York, Paris—where men are more willing to try different things. I can already see them on the streets here,” says London-based Maoui. “But I think baggier will always be more favorable, as bootcuts are still a pretty severe statement for guys who usually would wear straight-cut jeans. Do I think we’re going to see 30-something-year-olds in provincial towns up and down the UK wearing bootcut jeans just because one guy wore them for 15 minutes at the Super Bowl? No.” The Story Behind Kendrick Lamar’s 2025 Super Bowl Outfit, From the “Gloria” Jacket to the Bootcut Jeans Taylor Swift Brings Her Grammys “T” Pendant to the 2025 Super Bowl The Best and Boldest Tunnel Looks from Super Bowl LIX All the Celebrities Spotted at the 2025 Super Bowl—and What They Wore The Very Best Commercials From the 2025 Super Bowl More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

Kendall Jenner Is in Her Bob Dylan Era,https://www.vogue.com/article/kendall-jenner-is-in-her-bob-dylan-era,"February 11, 2025",By Olivia Allen,"If 2024 was the year of Kendall Jenner’s corporate cosplay, 2025 is shaping up to be a little less boardroom and a bit more Bob Dylan. In a departure from her usual clean-girl attire, Jenner is leaning into A Complete Unknown territory. Putting her own spin on the singer’s ’60s era–albeit wearing The Row and with a Birkin on her arm–Jenner seems to be embracing the influence of her honorary brother-in-law, Timothée Chalamet. Of course, Timmy himself has been method-dressing on the red carpet during his recent promo tour, from the blond hair and beanie that he sported for the New York premiere–paying homage to a Dylan look from the 2003 Sundance Film Festival—to his large collection of useless skinny scarves. Kendall Jenner is cosplaying as Bob Dylan. Unsurprisingly, Jenner has taken more of a fashion-led approach to the look, via on-trend suede jackets and Khaite’s straight-leg jeans, while also seemingly backing a baker boy hat revival. Whether this is a subtle pivot to a career in songwriting–they say dress for the job you want–or she’s simply listening to Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door on heavy rotation, we’re on board with Kendall Jenner’s new direction.

Sabrina Carpenter Loves a Famous Blonde Fashion Reference,https://www.vogue.com/article/sabrina-carpenter-famous-blonde-fashion-reference,"February 11, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Sabrina Carpenter has got that blonde ambition. Ever since the singer entered the pantheon of famous blondes, she’s been quick to reference her forebears through fashion. At the 2024 MTV VMAs, Carpenter and her stylist Jared Ellner achieved a two-for-one homage. In a silver beaded Bob Mackie dress from 1991, she pulled off a Russian nesting doll of nods, referencing Madonna referencing Marilyn Monroe. “It was originally designed for Madonna to wear to perform at the Academy Awards,” Alexis Novak, owner of Tab Vintage—where the dress was sourced—tells Vogue. “It was inspired by Marilyn Monroe in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and made headlines when she wore it.” Sabrina Carpenter at the 2024 MTV VMAs. Madonna at the Oscars. That same night, Carpenter paid tribute to another famous blonde: Kate Moss. Heading to the VMA after-party, she rocked a sheer white lace minidress over white underwear, which she paired with teetering white platforms and a kiss-print purse. The dress, from Tom Ford’s spring 1996 Gucci collection, was originally worn on the runway by the supermodel. A noted musical theater fan, Carpenter also incorporated some classic Hollywood references into her litany of Grammys looks. When she first hit the 2025 red carpet, she wore a pale blue custom JW Anderson dress complete with an ostrich feather trim. But the real star of the show was the massive pear diamond from Chopard, which hung down her bare back—a nod to Shirley MacLaine’s character Louisa May Foster in the 1964 film What a Way to Go! It didn’t end at the carpet though. For her performance—a medley of songs from Short n’ Sweet—Carpenter practically floated downstairs in a sequined Dolce & Gabbana tuxedo à la Goldie Hawn singing “Nobody Does It Like Me” on The Goldie Hawn Special. With Carpenter’s repertoire of deep cuts and a clear appreciation for Hollywood history, we can’t wait to see what’s next.

Looking Back at Sabrina Carpenter’s Red Carpet Evolution from Teeny Bopper to Bombshell,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/sabrina-carpenter-red-carpet-evolution,"February 11, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Sabrina Carpenter may only be 25-years-old, but she’s already an entertainment industry veteran. The now Grammy-winning singer got her start as a child actor, doing guest spots on Law & Order: SVU, Phineas and Ferb, and Orange Is the New Black before catching her big break with the Disney Channel show Girl Meets World in 2014. All that to say, she has a lot of red carpets under her belt. Carpenter has consistently proven herself a bold dresser, even as a child. At the Keep A Child Alive 20th Annual Dream Halloween event, she added a steampunk twist to a lace camisole and jean shorts with a leather vest, shredded cardigan, and ripped lace tights. While she leans into her femininity, she has also embraced suiting, wearing pinstripes at the 2018 People’s Choice Awards and a metallic champagne suit with contrasting black lapels at the Tall Girl premiere in 2019. The Short n’ Sweet singer really hit her sartorial stride in 2022, when she put forth her flirty femme style. At the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards, she rocked a multicolored floral Moschino dress riddled with daring cutouts. That same year she made her Met Gala debut in a glimmering gold Rabanne two-piece with a sweeping train. In 2023, Carpenter began working with her stylist Jared Ellner, who has outfitted her in body-skimming numbers, metallics, and pastels galore. Together they have fashioned Carpenter into a bona fide pop star, landing homages to Madonna and Marilyn Monroe, and walking her first Grammys red carpet in custom JW Anderson. Below, take a look back at Sabrina Carpenter’s red carpet evolution, from 2012 'til now.

"On the Podcast: Veronica Leoni, Calvin Klein’s New Creative Director, Says, “Calvin Is Not Just the Shape of a Coat or the Wash of a Denim. It’s a State of Mind.”",https://www.vogue.com/article/on-the-podcast-veronica-leoni-new-calvin-klein,"February 11, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"New York Fashion Week wraps up today, and this season was host to Veronica Leoni’s debut at Calvin Klein, the American behemoth label that had been dormant, at least on the runway, since the 2018 departure of Raf Simons. Leoni, a Roman designer who had spent time at Jil Sander (under Mrs. Sander), Phoebe Philo’s Celine, and The Row, showed her collection to a packed room full of industry insiders and, notably, Calvin Klein himself, who sat front row along with his muses Christy Turlington and Kate Moss. On this episode of The Run-Through, recorded two days after her debut show, Leoni joins Nicole Phelps to talk about her life growing up in Rome, studying philosophy and fashion theory, what she learned from working for influential female designers, and her approach to defining the new essence at Calvin Klein. “It’s almost like the ultimate American dream that you can export worldwide,” she says. “It’s a deep sense of beauty that is based on freedom of expression, spirited emotion, and cultural relevance.” More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

Statement Tights—and Socks!—Were the Real MVP of NYFW,https://www.vogue.com/article/new-york-fashion-week-breakout-trend-statement-tights-socks,"February 10, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"The fall 2025 shows at New York Fashion Week officially close out tomorrow, and the street style set has been out in their finest attire all week long; lots of peacocking! In case you missed it, Vogue’s Phil Oh has been documenting the best statement outfits in and outside of the shows—capturing how VIPs are dressing for the snow and slush in style. While artful layering and great coats have been spotted aplenty, there is a more stealthy wardrobe staple that has emerged as the real fashion MVP: Let’s hear it for tights and socks. Sure, a bright-colored tight or frilly sock may not seem like an instant outfit-maker, but this week, the accessories have elevated the street style set’s sprightly outfits from good to great. An animal-print jacket with a bright teal tight? Fun! An orange coat with argyle knee-highs? Fresh! In addition to keeping folks warm, tights and socks have also added a dash of personality and whimsy to winter looks. And the bold approach to wearing hosiery isn’t just happening off the runways: On the catwalks themselves, New York Fashion Week labels got into the spirit, too. Sandy Liang showed polka-dotted leggings underneath frilly skirts, while Anna Sui paired striped knee socks with striped knit mini skirts. You knows it’s a real trend with legs (pun intended) when both the runways and the crowds at the shows are partaking in the look. Out is the idea that socks or tights should be purely utilized for function, in is the reality that they can infuse a look with wow factor. Anna Sui fall 2025 Sandy Liang fall 2025 So, even if you weren’t in on the NYFW action this week, consider it a styling proposal to add fun hosiery to your winter wardrobe: Why slip on classic black or tights when you can inject an outfit with a great print or bold color instead? Do it, and a street style photographer may even track you down and ask for a photo. Well, one can at least fantasize. Below, more whimsical hosiery from New York Fashion Week.

"According to the Super Bowl, We’re in the Era of the Men’s Power Bag",https://www.vogue.com/article/mens-power-bags-trend-hermes-birkin-the-row,"February 10, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Last night in New Orleans, as pro athletes from the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles made their tunnel walk into the stadium for the 2025 Super Bowl, one couldn’t help but notice that the game-day fashions were on point. Football stars such as Travis Kelce and DeAndre Hopkins sauntered in wearing their best suits and streetwear—and punctuating their looks were some ultra-luxurious handbags. Each duffle bag was seemingly larger than the next. Kelce carried an oversized Ami Paris weekender bag, while Hollywood Brown chose a monogrammed Louis Vuitton top-handle style. DeVonta Smith carried an XXL Goyard clutch, tucked under his arm as a stealthy-chic styling move. It’s official: we’re in the era of the men’s power bag. Famous men—from athletes to rappers—are all in the power bag era, choosing extremely chic totes and duffles that range from big Bottegas to even bigger Birkins. Last year Harry Styles emerged in Paris carrying The Row’s luxe leather Margaux bag in tow, which retails for $4,390. It’s fast becoming a celebrity It bag, having also been worn by stars such as Kendall Jenner and Jennifer Lawrence. Sure, men get a bad rap for wearing extremely pragmatic bags (please, no more beaten-up briefcase or ratty backpacks), but as more men in Hollywood and beyond experiment with their style, it seems their approach to accessories is leveling up, too. One of my favorite style moments as of late was when A$AP Rocky stepped out in a baby pink woven Bottega Veneta tote—a bag that’s decidedly feminine, yet on a man, just seems that much cooler. He styled it nonchalantly, with baggy jeans and a blazer. What does this newfound willingness to rock a men’s power bag—bags that are bold and get you noticed—say about the current times? For one, it obviously means that self-expression in fashion is freeing up; we’re no longer calling men’s bags stupid things like “murses.” But it also reflects a bigger fashion shift in which men are now willing to invest in more expensive and refined pieces. Perhaps we can point to the stealth wealth trend, which has put emphasis on quality over quantity. (Though, there’s nothing subtle about stars like Travis Scott and his huge collection of XXL Birkins.) Whatever it is, it’s nice that we’re finally starting to see gents shed the basic business-y briefcases or backpacks they’ve had since college, and have more fun. Thank goodness! And men, you don’t have to go out and splurge on an expensive designer bag, either—it’s more about channeling the spirit and feeling you're after. Look for styles that feel smart and elevated, whether a top-handle or a cross-body. A power bag is the best investment piece for looking like a total boss. Why dress like an employee when you can look like the CEO? More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Jennifer Lawrence Is a Fan of This Cozy Winter Wardrobe Staple,https://www.vogue.com/article/jennifer-lawrence-cozy-winter-staple-flannel-shirt,"February 10, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Winter in New York City is no joke: It’s a serious sartorial challenge to stay warm, yet look fashion forward at the same time. Any true New Yorker knows that a good power coat and a rotating array of knitwear become your seasonal hero pieces. (Pepper in some fun scarves and hats, and you’ve got a presentable winter wardrobe.) Jennifer Lawrence is one such Manhattan A-lister who knows what she’s doing. The star has been spotted out and about in the crisp, cold streets this month in looks that strike a balance between polished and cozy. And she has one staple that she keeps on returning to. Lawrence’s secret weapon for the winter? A classic flannel shirt—those checkered wool button-ups that you often wear camping (and are popular among lumberjacks). Just earlier today in New York, Lawrence was spotted wearing a blue plaid style, layered underneath a classic black overcoat, a knit beanie, and dark-wash jeans. She has previously worn a gingham flannel shirt, and layered it with a thick wool scarf overtop. It doesn’t take much to understand the appeal of a classic flannel like Lawrence’s. Often finished with extra-plushy wools or cashmeres, the garment certainly keeps one warm, but also provides a pop of color, thanks to the addition of a colorful plaid print. You may have even seen flannels on the runways lately: brands like Bottega Veneta and The Row have shown luxurious versions. It’s the type of investment piece that you’ll never regret owning, given that it can double as loungewear or PJs around the house (and make a great blanket for the plane, too). When slipping into one in the city, though, consider Lawrence’s approach and dress it up with a tailored coat. The vibe is snuggly-chic—not full-on lumberjack.

Ariana Grande Is Back to Her Witchy Ways,https://www.vogue.com/article/ariana-grande-is-back-to-her-witchy-ways,"February 10, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Ariana Grande was once again crowned the Witch of the West (Coast) yesterday when she hit the Santa Barbara International Film Festival dressed in—you guessed it—full Glinda attire. The Wicked star joined the likes of Selena Gomez, Mikey Madison, and Monica Barbaro for the festival’s Virtuosos Award. Grande looked the portrait of a good witch in a pink Giorgio Armani dress. The spaghetti strap gown was festooned with floral appliqués that trailed down her full ball skirt. Beyond the 3D flowers, the dress was embellished to the nth degree, from the pink rhinestoned straps to the polka-dot netted overlay floating atop the striped skirt. The custom Armani dress joins a long list of Grande’s Glinda-approved custom looks. She hosted SNL in a vintage magenta Thierry Mugler tulip dress from fall 1982, and attended the Olympics Opening Ceremony in Paris wearing a ladylike Thom Browne tea-length dress with a drop waist. (And that’s nothing to say of the custom Bode, Louis Vuitton, and Balenciaga she’s donned throughout her press tour.) But Grande has also departed from the Good Witch. For a brief period on the awards circuit, she adopted an homage to Audrey Hepburn in vintage Givenchy from 1966—and baby bangs to boot—at the 2025 Golden Globes. And at the 2025 Critics Choice Awards last week, she ditched vintage for fresh-off-the-runway Dior couture. But now as the Oscars approach, it seems Ariana Grande is fully switched back into Glinda mode. Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

Revisiting Kate Middleton’s BAFTA Gowns Through the Years,https://www.vogue.com/article/kate-middleton-baftas-through-the-years,"February 10, 2025",By Hayley Maitland,"Rumour has it that Kate Middleton will be present and correct at this year’s BAFTAs, although Kensington Palace has yet to formally confirm her presence at Royal Festival Hall on the night. If the Princess of Wales does make her red carpet return, expect her look to be a relatively subdued one (and, most likely, a repeat wear) given her recent push to shift the public’s focus from her clothes to her work. The senior royal has, after all, been recycling gowns at black-tie events for years. Ahead of the ceremony on February 16, revisit all of her BAFTA appearances so far, below. For her most recent appearance at the BAFTAs, the Princess of Wales recycled her Alexander McQueen gown from the 2019 ceremony, pairing it with elbow-length gloves, an added chiffon sleeve, and a pair of Zara earrings. 2023 was a significant year for the awards, with the ceremony held at the Southbank Centre’s Royal Festival Hall for the first time. However, changes to the show format were overshadowed by a lack of progress regarding diversity on the night. The academy provided all guests at the 2020 BAFTAs—one of the last major events before the pandemic sent the world into lockdown—with a sustainable dressing guide courtesy of the London College of Fashion. The Duchess of Cambridge acknowledged the theme by dipping into her Alexander McQueen archive, choosing to rewear a dress from her 2012 tour of Southeast Asia in honor of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. A custom design by Sarah Burton, its cream fabric is overlaid with a hibiscus flower print—a nod to Malaysia’s national flower, as Kate first wore the dress to meet the country’s own royal family. In terms of jewelry, the Duchess selected a mother-of-pearl necklace and earrings from Van Cleef & Arpels’s Magic Alhambra collection for the night. For the 2019 BAFTAs, the Duchess of Cambridge selected a one-shouldered Alexander McQueen gown with floral embellishments. She had appeared in a similar dress in a rose colorway for the then Prince of Wales’s 70th birthday a few months earlier. It’s her jewelry, however, that predictably garnered headlines. Kate chose a pair of drop earrings inherited from Diana, Princess of Wales, featuring diamonds and South Sea pearls. Poignantly, the late royal wore the jewels to her last official engagement—a performance of Swan Lake at the Royal Albert Hall in 1997. The 2018 BAFTAs will be remembered as a watershed moment in the Me Too movement, with Sisters Uncut storming the red carpet to protest the terms of then Prime Minister Theresa May’s domestic violence and abuse bill. While the vast majority of female attendees wore black in a nod to Time’s Up, the Duchess of Cambridge opted for a politically neutral flowing dark-green gown by Jenny Packham, with a black sash tied above her pregnancy bump. She then accessorized her dress with a suite of emerald jewelry—emeralds being associated with hope and renewal, as well as the suffragette movement. For her 2017 BAFTAs debut, the Duchess of Cambridge turned again to Alexander McQueen, wearing a tiered off-the-shoulder gown embroidered with pale flowers—a custom take on a look from the brand’s spring 2016 resort collection—with diamond chandelier earrings. Kate later wore a variation on the same dress to an event at the National Portrait Gallery. Kate Middleton’s Wardrobe Spoke Volumes. What Will Happen Now That It’s Silenced?

Meghan Markle Is Back in Her Favorite Skinny-Flare Jeans,https://www.vogue.com/article/meghan-markle-invictus-games-skinny-flare-jeans,"February 10, 2025",By Olivia Allen,"Meghan Markle has long mastered the art of laid-back luxury—as shown during a series of appearances over the weekend at the 2025 Invictus Games in Vancouver. While attending the wheelchair basketball event on Sunday, the Duchess of Sussex stepped out in a pair of Veronica Beard skinny-flare jeans, teamed with a navy jumper from La Ligne and heeled boots by Stuart Weitzman. The royal’s love affair with denim is well documented, spanning everything from the ever-divisive skinny jean to co-ord sets. And who could forget that for her very first public appearance with Prince Harry at the Invictus Games in Toronto, back in 2017, Meghan wore a pair of ripped jeans from Mother Denim, teamed with her white “Husband” shirt from friend Misha Nonoo’s eponymous brand. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry at the Invictus Games in Vancouver over the weekend. Beyond her love of denim, Meghan is known for re-wearing and reinterpreting her favorite pieces. Her loyalty to Veronica Beard dates back to the late 2010s, and she was first spotted wearing her Stuart Weitzman boots back in 2017. Meanwhile, the royal also revisited another favorite brand for the Invictus Games Opening Ceremony via a coat from Sentaler—a Canadian label she’s worn a number of times over the years.

"The Story Behind Kendrick Lamar’s 2025 Super Bowl Outfit, From the “Gloria” Jacket to the Bootcut Jeans",https://www.vogue.com/article/kendrick-lamar-2025-super-bowl-outfit-fashion-story,"February 9, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"As expected, rapper and Pulitzer Prize winner Kendrick Lamar completely owned the stage at the 2025 Super Bowl Halftime show in New Orleans tonight. The rapper was joined by SZA for his much-anticipated performance, as well as special guest appearances from Samuel L. Jackson (dressed in custom Bode as a well-clad Uncle Sam character), Mustard, and Serena Williams, who served as one of his background dancers. (All of the dancers were dressed in shades of blue, red, and white—the three colors of the American flag.) Given the musician always uses his fashion choices for a deeper meaning—his looks tend to bear messages, whether there are obvious or hidden meanings behind them—it was no surprise that his Super Bowl outfit tonight also told a much larger story. Styled by Taylor McNeill, the rapper wore bootcut Celine jeans (Y2K style is back, according to Lamar and other stars like Pharrell Williams), as well as a custom leather Martine Rose varsity jacket that spelled out “Gloria” along the front. (At first, a lot of viewers actually mistook it for the Florida Gators logo.) So, what was the story behind that bold jacket? True Kendrick fans will know that “Gloria” serves as the closing track on his 2024 album, GNX. According to outlets such as Genius, Gloria serves as a metaphor for Lamar’s pen game. “The woman Kendrick speaks of serves as a conceit, becoming an extended metaphor for the discussion of his craft,” reads an explanation. “Gloria, which means ‘glory’ in Spanish, becomes a personification of rap glory—his ‘pen’ and the artistic journey it represents.” Around his neck, the star also donned a hefty chain necklace with a lowercase “a” pendant on it—a nod to his lyrics in “Not Like Us,” in which Lamar raps, “Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A-minorrrrrr.” (The song is a Drake diss track—you can read all about the meaning behind that specific line here.) Lamar wasn’t the only star on the halftime stage to use his fashion choices to nod back to his music, either. SZA was styled by Alejandra LaPilusa for her performance. The singer sported a custom red leather jacket by Born x Raised that bore a white Lana logo on the chest, the title of her 2024 album, as well as “Crybaby” on the back, which is the title of one of its songs. Both stars used their moment in the global spotlight to connect their attire back to the soul of their records—they are their own best billboards, after all.

All the Celebrities Spotted at the 2025 Super Bowl—and What They Wore,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/celebrities-at-super-bowl-lix,"February 9, 2025",By Vogue,"Super Bowl LIX may be underway in New Orleans, but celebs have been celebrating the annual event all weekend long—and doing so in fashion. Friday night saw NFL stars CeeDee Lamb and Ja'Marr Chase walk in the fall 2025 Bode show (hosted with our friends at GQ and aptly titled the GQ Bowl) and Meg Thee Stallion was spotted out and about in the Big Easy, wearing everything from a casual crop top and cargo pants to a mesh bodysuit printed with a skeleton. Come kick-off—with the Kansas City Chiefs facing off against the Philadelphia Eagles—stars spotted in the stands and VIP boxes included Philadelphia native (and Eagles super fan Bradley Cooper) as well as Ice Spice, the Haim sisters, and of course, Taylor Swift. Fashion has run the gamut from laid back to dressed up to football fan chic. Earlier this weekend, Gabrielle Union opted for a high-cut white bodysuit and baggy jeans, while Martha Stewart packed a staple from her closet: a cardigan. Paul Rudd is wearing his Chiefs allegiance on his sleeve, sporting a red, white, and gold button-down. Ahead, all the celebs spotted at the 2025 Super Bowl—and what they wore.

Lady Gaga Performs in Delightful Mother Monster Fashion at the 2025 Super Bowl,https://www.vogue.com/article/lady-gaga-super-bowl-2025-performance-fashion,"February 9, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"It wouldn’t be the Super Bowl without a surprise celebrity performance, now would it? Tonight in New Orleans, just before the big 2025 game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles kicked off, singer Lady Gaga took to the stage for a special piano rendition of her 2022 song “Hold My Hand.” The pre-recorded performance, staged outside on the iconic Bourbon Street, was meant to serve as an uplifting tribute to the resilient local community in New Orleans, who all rallied and supported one another following the terrorist attack that occurred there on New Year’s Day. Gaga performed her touching song on the piano, accompanied by a live band. She chose an all-white look—a color often associated with peace, hope, and new beginnings—that felt perfectly appropriate for the occasion, given the mood of the night. But because she had to give her stage look a major Mother Monster feel, too, the star sported a dramatic wide-brimmed chapeau, as well as a white lace coat with a long, sweeping train. (The outerwear was similar in feel to the high-collared lace cape made of recycled wedding dresses that she recently wore in her new music video for “Abracadabra.”) Gaga released “Hold My Hand” back in 2022, as part of the Top Gun: Maverick soundtrack. Her live rendition of it on Sunday night made for an unexpected opening game-day moment—but one that was obviously greeted with delight by a stadium full of cheering fans.

Taylor Swift Brings Her Grammys “T” Pendant to the 2025 Super Bowl,https://www.vogue.com/article/taylor-swift-super-bowl-2025-fashion-t-necklace,"February 9, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Happy Super Bowl Sunday to all those who celebrate! Tonight in New Orleans, the Kansas City Chiefs face off against the Philadelphia Eagles, and tons of stars are in the crowd to cheer on both teams. Of course, many have been wondering if Taylor Swift would show up for the big game, given boyfriend Travis Kelce will be hitting the field for the Chiefs. Swiftie fans, we are pleased to report that the superstar has indeed shown up. Arriving with her posse of friends (including Ice Spice and the Haim sisters), Swift arrived in a tailored double-breasted white blazer, bejeweled denim shorts, and thigh-high boots. (What, no Chiefs red tonight?). But it was her choice of jewelry that was particularly eye-catching. Around her neck, Swift wore a rosary-style necklace by Lorraine Schwartz with a “T” pendant (for Taylor, obviously, but it could also be for Travis). If it looks familiar, it’s because Swift wore the same exact piece to the Grammy Awards just last week—though she sported it around her thigh on the red carpet, paired with her red Vivienne Westwood Couture dress. Perhaps it’s her new good luck charm, and she is wearing it to bring all the good vibes in order for the Chiefs to win. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Swift is no stranger to a game-day fashion moment. While supporting Kelce from the stands (or, rather, her private VIP box), the singer has worn everything from Louis Vuitton and Charlotte Simons to vintage Chiefs merch. But tonight, Swift was clearly feeling a brand new fashion vibe, opting for a clean and minimal color palette. She’s always one to keeps you guessing!

The Best and Boldest Tunnel Looks from Super Bowl LIX,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/the-best-tunnel-looks-from-super-bowl-lix,"February 9, 2025",By Leah Faye Cooper,"All season long NFL players have been flexing their fashion prowess, arriving to game day in looks befitting of a runway (or Vogue editorial). These stylish walks culminate tonight in New Orleans, where the Kansas City Chiefs face off against the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LIX. Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce (known in many circles as Taylor Swift's boyfriend) was one of the first players to catch our attention this evening. Stepping into the Big Easy's Caesars Superdome, Kelce wore an oversized Amiri suit in a color best described as a mix between rust, burnt orange, and pumpkin spice latte. The elongated blazer, shimmery top, and black and white loafers were bold enough on their own, but Kelce took the look to Saturday Night Fever-esque heights with a gilded rose brooch, gold necklace, retro-tinted tortoiseshell shades, and an unbuttoning of his shirt that revealed ample chest hair. Meanwhile, Eagles' quarterback Jalen Hurts continued his season-long affinity for sleek tailoring, opting for a royal purple suit. Worn with a matching, collarless purple shirt and black loafers, Hurts leaned into a tunnel trend we've seen since week 1: the giant leather bag. For Super Bowl Sunday, Hurts went with Coach's Empire Bag. Of all the looks we took note of this evening—Charles Omenihu's crystal-embellished trousers and matching vest along with his aqua Louis Vuitton duffle really lit up the group chat—we were especially touched by what DeAndre Hopkins chose to wear. “My dad died in 1992 and he left me a couple things,” Hopkins shared during a pre-game press conference. “One of the things that he left me was a mink jacket. I always said I would wear that mink jacket to my wedding or to the Super Bowl—whichever happened first. Obviously, I'm not married, so I'm gonna wear my daddy's mink jacket.” Ahead, the best and boldest tunnel looks from Super Bowl LIX. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

Prince Harry is a patron for the organization, after all, and he and the Duchess of Sussex have been steady supporters of the games for years—a multi-sport event held for wounded, injured, and sick military service personnel. Yesterday, the 2025 Games kicked off in the city, and the royal couple were once again on-hand in the crowd to witness the official kickoff ceremony. Naturally, Markle brought a polished and elegant look to the affair, and kept warm by choosing one of her go-to coat brands. The Duchess opted for an ivory double-breasted trench coat from Sentaler, a Canadian luxury outerwear brand that she has worn plenty of styles from over the years. Her latest? A refined alpaca and wool coat, finished off with corozo buttons, and that retails for $2,290. She styled it minimally, with a black knit dress that allowed her outerwear to be the focal point. The Duchess of Sussex has proven to be a fan (and repeat wearer) of Sentaler’s sleek and minimal coats over the years. Markle has worn the brand’s camel coats and bright red power coats, both discreet to statement styles. And by choosing a Canadian label for a Canadian-bred event, she clearly wanted to pay tribute to the homegrown talent in the country—a thoughtful and royal touch by Meghan Markle, and not to mention, an extremely chic one.

The Best Dressed Stars of the Week Donned Great Coats—and Greater Gowns,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/10-best-dressed-stars-ariana-grande-kate-moss-ayo-edebiri,"February 9, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Between awards season in Hollywood, and the New York Fashion Week fall 2025 shows, there were plenty of stellar red carpet moments to be had in the last seven days. Naturally, the step and repeats were filled with star power. But the best dressed celebrities? It was the A-listers who leaned into sublime winter dressing—slipping into some of the most elegant gowns of the season, and a serious array of power coats, too. In New York, stylish showgoers braved the snow in sleek outerwear that made a statement. Kendall Jenner, for one—who just walked the Calvin Klein runway show—stepped out in a plushy Phoebe Philo jacket (that retails for a cool $11,000), pairing it with black tights and studious spectacles. Also at the Calvin show, the spectacting supermodel Kate Moss proved that the classic appeal of a black topcoat will never tire—especially when paired with a slinky slip dress, a garment that always brings us back to the ’90s. Hailey Bieber also slipped into vintage, stepping out for date night with Justin Bieber in a vintage Mugler jacket and skirt suit. In Hollywood, meanwhile, the looks were a little more lightweight, emphasizing a polished final look with an elegant assortment of gowns. At the 2025 Directors Guild of America Awards, Ayo Edebiri shone in a chocolate brown Khaite silk dress, as did Zoe Saldaña in a polka-dot Nina Ricci number. At the 2025 Critics Choice Awards, Ariana Grande donned a sculptural Dior Couture dress in tulle and crinoline that took 3,800 hours to make. It was not in Glinda pink, per her Oscar-nominated Wicked character—but it was fit for a magical being. Which were your favorite celebrity looks this week?

The Best NFL Looks from the 2024-2025 Season,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/2025-best-nfl-fashion,"February 9, 2025",By Taylor Anderson,"Super Bowl LIX is just hours away! Tonight, the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles are set to battle for NFL supremacy in New Orleans. The big stage will see Patrick Mahomes’s Kansas City Chiefs and Jalen Hurt’s Philadelphia Eagles compete, 14-time Grammy winner Taylor Swift and her besties cheer on her beau Travis Kelce, and a halftime performance by Kendrick Lamar and SZA. In other words, we’re all in for a treat! While the game is bound to be exciting, here at Vogue we’re curious to see how the players will dress with all eyes on them. The tunnel at the Super Bowl is arguably the hottest runway of the season (and happens to coincide with New York Fashion Week). If the 2024–2025 season indicates the looks we can anticipate on the biggest night of football season, we're bound to see some very memorable fits. This season has been a stylish playground for athletes, with players leaning into expressing themselves through fashion. Notably, 2024–2025 was also the season the NFL hired its first-ever fashion editor, Kyle Smith. From a unique take on traditional suiting seen on Devonta Smith to bold prints on Pat Surtain II, each game-day look was a winning choice in its own right. Ahead of Super Bowl LIX, look back at Vogue’s favorite looks from the 2024–2025 NFL season.

The Coolest Jeans of 2025 Are a Hybrid of Two Classics,https://www.vogue.com/article/baggy-bootcut-denim-trend-2025,"February 9, 2025",By Daisy Jones,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. As a woman who is, scientifically speaking, the same height as Lady Gaga, I’ve always struggled with what jeans to wear. Skinny jeans make my legs look like they’re actually suffocating and baggy jeans tend to swallow me whole. There’s a particular type of denim cut, though, that I’ve always gravitated towards–although I’ve never known what to call them. Part baggy, part bootcut, I’ve recently taken to calling them “slacker jeans,” and they’re pretty much all I wear. The best way to describe slacker jeans is bootcut, but not in that classically tight, early Noughties way. Rather, they’re slouchy, with a slight flare – the type of jeans that are custom-made for pulling on when you’re in a hurry, or throwing a big brown leather jacket over. Baggy bootcuts are, in my opinion, the epitome of casual cool. And, though they’re most often associated with menswear, women look killer in them too (as I’ve said before, give us more menswear in women’s sizes!) I’m not just plucking these jeans out of thin air. This particular cut has been slouching its way down runways on both sides of the fashion binary more recently. From the cowboy-ish kick-flares that were all over Louis Vuitton’s autumn/winter 2025 runway, to the puddling hemlines seen at Fendi, Dsquared2 and Ami’s spring/summer 2025 shows, hip-skimming slacker jeans dominated menswear collections. But they’ve crept into womenswear, too. From floor-scraping denim at Dries Van Noten’s autumn/winter 2024 show to Natasha Zinko’s pre-fall 2025 collection, the humble flare has gotten so slouchy the hem is practically under the shoe. Dries Van Noten autumn/winter 2024 Fendi spring/summer 2025 Fortunately, this type of baggy bootcut is also all over the high street, if you know where to look. My personal affordable faves are these Bershka bootcuts (size up for maximum slouch), or else the loose bootcuts available at Weekday. The ultimate pair, however, is Eytys’ take on the trend (if you’ve got the coin to spend) and, obviously, all manner of men’s jeans from Diesel. Big and boyish puddle-soakers have never looked so tempting.

"Hailey Bieber Means Business in Original Office Siren, Archive Mugler for Date Night",https://www.vogue.com/article/hailey-bieber-archive-mugler-suit-for-date-night,"February 9, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Nicole Kidman, Elle Fanning, Ayo Edebiri—women are having a lot of fun with their tailoring right now. While Kidman and Fanning lean into the sharp and loose masculine shapes, and Edebiri goes hard on the referencing à la Julia Roberts, it’s the turn of suit-savant Hailey Bieber to show what she can do with formalwear. Stepping out on another day night with husband Justin, Hailey Bieber looked like she meant business in vintage Mugler from the fall winter 1998 collection, styled as usual by longtime collaborator Dani Michelle. The pinstripe skirt suit comprised a fitted blazer with padded shoulders, a nipped-in waist, and low front—which she wore shirtless—and a matching knee-length pencil skirt with a slit. She wore black stilettos and sheer tights, and kept her growing caramel hair long and straight. Sunglasses, as usual, stayed on, and her Rhode espresso-toned phone case was in her hand. Her husband Justin walked just behind her, keeping low key in an oversized black hoodie, pants, and a neon yellow beanie. The suit was sourced from The RealList, a vintage and second-hand luxury dealer specializing in 90s and early 2000s fashion that’s become a mecca for the it-girls. The RealList co-founders Alex Cohen and Grant Ellis tell Vogue that the skirt suit from their archive is from the fall winter 1998 ‘Lingerie Revisited’ Mugler collection: “A variation of Hailey Bieber’s set appeared on the season’s runway and in an incredibly moody Helmut Newton photoshoot in Monaco.” “The blazer features a plunging neckline, while the skirt features a wrap-style with an ultra-high slit. Manfred was a master of design, and his suiting options still stand out today. His understanding and appreciation of the female form have allowed his designs to transcend time, being as relevant now as ever.” The Thierry Mugler suit is from Cohen and Ellis’s private archive, accessible only to a small group of loyal VIP clients: “We’ve had the pleasure of working with [Bieber’s stylist] Dani Michelle and her incredible team for years, and they frequently turn to us for rare, archival pieces from our private collection. We sent Dani multiple options for this look, and this Mugler set won out. She only shows the best to her clients and always knows what will resonate. A true professional, Dani has an expert eye and an effortless ability to give vintage pieces a modern edge.” Olivia Rodrigo also picked up a Mugler mini-dress from The RealList at the end of last year, from the same era, and Kylie Jenner a black fur chubby coat by Tom Ford for Gucci. As we know, Hailey loves a suit: Whether it’s made more casual as separates or the full corporate powerhouse shabang in a double-breasted suit, button-up, and necktie from Saint Laurent’s spring 2025 collection. Powering dressing done the Bieber way. Hailey Bieber is by now a frequent customer of Ellis and Cohen’s, having picked up a vintage brown skirt suit from Gianni Versace’s fall 1996 collection and a vintage faux fur from them too. She wore it for her return to office, following the birth of her and Justin’s son, Jack Blues. Date night is just as much a serious business for the Biebers.

Taylor Swift Steps Out for a Pre-Super Bowl Girl Dinner in a Groupie’s Favorite Coat,https://www.vogue.com/article/taylor-swift-super-bowl-penny-lane-coat,"February 9, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Touchdown! Game day is here, we’ve reached Super Bowl Sunday 2025. The Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs are set to face off, Kendrick Lamar will headline the halftime show, and Taylor Swift is going to wear something—likely in Chiefs red—and support her boyfriend Travis Kelce. The city of New Orleans is abuzz, and on a vibrant pre-match Saturday, Swift was spotted out for dinner at Gianna’s. How best to settle your nerves than a rustic Italian with a Southern twist, shared with some of your best girl friends, the HAIM sisters? Swift was photographed arriving with pals and musical collaborators Este, Danielle, and Alana Haim, wearing a fluffy Penny Lane coat—a style favored by both she and Haim for its feminine ’70s style. The Reputation singer wore a Charlotte Simone Billie Jacket, with towering Saint Laurent platform ankle boots. The cropped black faux leather jacket has a shaggy, biscotti brown trim and sleeves. Swift also toted a soft, slouchy leather and Dior D Journey Bag with gold hardware, and wore a Louis Vuitton Blossom ring and Ben Amun Roman linked coin necklace. The Penny Lane style coat is known as such for the fictional rock groupie Penny Lane, played by Kate Hudson in the 2000 cult classic film Almost Famous. Her ’70s-inspired bohemian style has sporadically come back around again, and the Afghan coat is having a particular moment: From Kendall Jenner to Bella Hadid, wearing true vintage styles or Copenhagen’s Saks Potts, and Swift’s fave, British brand Charlotte Simone. Swift’s winter WAG (‘wives and girlfriends,’ for the uninitiated) wardrobe has incorporated the coat silhouette on several occasions. In December, she headed to the Arrowhead Stadium where the Kansas City Chiefs were facing off with the Houston Texans wearing the Lulu faux fur coat from British label Charlotte Simone. She also wore a felted vintage Chanel bucket hat, Sheertex argyle tights, knee-high Manolo Blahnik black boots, and an oxblood leather handbag from Tods. Her game day wardrobe runs the gamut of labels and Chiefs-toned fits. For Kelce’s crucial play-offs match up against the Houston Texans, Swift sported full Chanel from the 2025 Resort collection. She wore a tweed black and white jacket, a black quarter-zip wool romper, and pointy knee-high boots. She accessorized with more Chanel too: a pearl and gold belt, interlocking CC logo earrings, and a black mini-quilted bag. So who’s to say what Taylor Swift’s finale fit could be? More groupie fashion? Chiefs red? Logomania or something more subtly supportive? We’ll all be tuning in to watch the event unfold at the New Orleans’s Caesars Superdome later.

Industry’s Marisa Abela Channeled Her Inner Countess Luann at the 2025 Critics Choice Awards,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/marisa-abela-2025-critics-choice-awards,"February 8, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"When it came time for the 2025 Critics Choice Awards, Dior dressed Industry star Marisa Abela like a true princess. Well, in this case, maybe a countess: At awards shows, the actor likes to tap into her inner Bravolebrity—Countess Luann de Lesseps, specifically. “Be cool, don’t be all…like…uncool,” she says of her red carpet mantra, borrowed from the Real Housewife-slash-cabaret star. And it’s really only fitting, given that Abela’s character Yasmin Kara-Hanani ends season three of the HBO series on the brink of marrying into aristocracy. In her day-to-day, Abela considers her style “simple and chic meets Mediterranean vampire.” She held onto some of that energy while celebrating Industry’s Critics Choice nomination for best drama series on Friday night, opting for a red wine-colored velvet dress with a corseted bodice and a dramatic flared ball skirt, whose tones she matched with her Dior Beauty look. “[Dior] sent a bunch of sketches to my stylist Aimee Croysdill and we went through them together,” Abela tells Vogue of bringing the look to life. “This dress just stood out as classically elegant and beautiful, and the very thin spaghetti straps grave it this sexy, modern twist. I just fell in love with it immediately.” While Industry is gearing up for its fourth season, the tight-knit cast never wastes a moment spent together. Win or lose, Abela looked forward to enjoying the evening with her castmates, including Myha’la and Sagar Radia (all of whom landed spots on Vogue’s Best Dressed list). “The people make the celebration, and I can’t wait to just celebrate this moment with my friends,” she says. “I’m so grateful for and proud of them.” Below Marisa Abela takes Vogue along for the ride as she gets ready for the 2025 Critics Choice Awards. I flew on the eve of critics choice… And went straight for a facial with Lena from Carasoin. Gotta beat the jet lag somehow. I got an early night and was up early, excited for the day! Bagged a workout at the Barry’s in West Hollywood. I love classes like this in LA, it’s such a culture shock. In London I don’t think an instructor could ever get the whole class to yell and sing and dance throughout a workout, I have to work to turn down the volume on the very British voice in my head… Got home! Showered! Facetimed my love! More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Angelina Jolie Brought a Boho Twist to the Naked Dress Trend at the 2025 Critics Choice Awards,https://www.vogue.com/article/angelina-jolie-boho-naked-dress-trend-critics-choice-awards-2025,"February 8, 2025",By Fernanda Pérez Sánchez,"Angelina Jolie has her fashion formula down for red carpets. Across the promo for her film Maria, the actor has stepped out in elegant and minimalist dresses, finding comfort in neutral colors and ethereal silhouettes. Attending last night’s Critics Choice Awards 2025, Jolie was nominated in the best actress category. Her look brought her own understated take on the ever-enduring naked dress trend. Angelina Jolie at the Critics Choice Awards 2025 in an Elie Saab dress. For the event, Jolie opted for her signature style of simple elegance with a boho touch, wearing a sheer beige lace dress with relaxed sleeves and V-neckline from Elie Saab’s spring 2025 collection. She kept her hands and neck bare, wearing only barely there drop earrings. For her glam, she kept it to pops of red, with cherry red lips and nail polish. Her hair continued the boho vibe, blonde with darker roots that gave it dimension, and long feathery, ’70s bangs. Jolie was up in the same category as Wicked’s Cynthia Erivo, Demi Moore for The Substance, Karla Sofía Gascón for Emilia Pérez, Marianne Jean-Baptiste for Hard Truths, and Anora’s Mikey Madison. Moore took the win for the night, wearing full Schiaparelli. Throughout her press tour for the Pablo Larrain film, Jolie has turned out in multiple chic ensembles. Always elegant, whether she’s in a vintage gown with no label or a sleek three-piece suit. More recently at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, she showed her continued love of the slinky A-lister dress, wearing a champagne-colored silk floor-length dress with a draped white blazer. Boho chic, slinky megastar ensembles, naked dressing—Angelina Jolie’s long cultivated red carpet looks remain unmatched. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Zoe Saldaña Stuns in Red—and Surprises With an Open Back—at the 2025 Critics Choice Awards,https://www.vogue.com/article/zoe-saldana-red-saint-laurent-critics-choice-awards-2025,"February 8, 2025",By Lorena Meouchi,"The campaign for best supporting actress across 2025’s awards season has been tough—and the fashion stakes made even higher. On that road, Zoe Saldaña’s wardrobe has encompassed classic glamor and artisanship, including two Margiela haute couture gowns and a swathe of Saint Laurent. (The latter house’s production company, Saint Laurent Productions, co-produced and costumed Emilia Pérez.) Up for—and winning!—best supporting actress at last night’s Critics Choice Awards, Saldaña once again showed her deepening relationship with the French house. Zoe Saldaña was up against (The equally well-dressed) Isabella Rossellini, Margaret Qualley, Danielle Deadwyler, Ariana Grande, and Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor in the category. “To my fellow nominees, the films this year and the work you’ve all done. It’s breathtaking,” she said when accepting the award. “I will forever be proud to be among you. Thank you to all of you. I can’t see you, but you… Rock.” She wore a fiery red custom Saint Laurent dress by Anthony Vaccarello, with draped shoulder pads and a flowing skirt. The dress had a surprise open back, held together by singular button and a black bow. Saldaña was styled by her longtime collaborator, stylist Petra Flannery. She also wore a satin choker and Cartier jewelry. Her beauty, too, kept to the “ultra-modern” glam that hairstylist Mara Roszak has been fostering with each appearance, with a super-long, slicked back ponytail. Saint Laurent designer Vaccarello’s presence on the Critics Choice red carpet was expansive too, as nominee Nicole Kidman donned a more masculine, structured tailored suit from the spring 2025 collection to cosplay as her Babygirl co-star. For the Golden Globes—where she also took the best supporting actress win—Saldaña wore an espresso brown Saint Laurent sequin gown with a plunging sweetheart neckline, accessorized with Cartier jewelry and Saint Laurent bag and shoes.

Nicole Kidman Is So Babygirl’s Samuel in Her 2025 Critics Choice Awards Look,https://www.vogue.com/article/nicole-kidman-saint-laurent-babygirl-suit-critics-choice-awards-2025,"February 8, 2025",By Fernanda Pérez Sánchez,"While the 30th annual Critics Choice Awards 2025 was a more muted affair this year, with attendees’ fashion choices leaning more into darker tones and simple silhouettes, there remained some dynamic moments. One being Nicole Kidman: the star of Babygirl decided to channel her co-star Harris Dickinson’s character Samuel in a structured blazer and pleated greige pants from Saint Laurent spring 2025. Kidman wore her voluminous blonde hair parted in the middle with subtle but well-defined waves. Nicole Kidman at the Critics Choice Awards 2025. Diverging from the Saint Laurent runway styling, Kidman wore the suit with a pale blue shirt and navy blue tie with white polka dots. Very important day in the big office vibe. For footwear, she wore black pointed pumps. The angular silhouette of the jacket, juxtaposed with the more fluid pants, reflected an assured sense of corporate power. And it makes total sense, then, when you consider the Saint Laurent spring 2025 foundations. “My last men’s show in March had been all about tailoring, but based on flou; I wanted this one to be the opposite—more strict,” Anthony Vaccarello of Saint Laurent said of the collection Kidman’s suit comes from. “It’s not about when I would do a tuxedo for a woman which was worn naked underneath. The suits come with shirts, ties. You’re dressed. It’s about control, and power, in a way.” While the look definitely channels more the energy of Kidman’s character’s sexual fantasy rather than company intern vibe, it also reflects the enduring power of the suit on this current awards season circuit. Case en point: Ayo Edebiri’s expert referencing of the Julia Roberts moment with markedly masculine tailoring at the 2025 Golden Globes. Ayo Edebiri at the Golden Globes 2025. Julia Roberts at the 1990 Golden Globes. Kidman was nominated not for Babygirl, but for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her work in Special Ops: Lioness for the Critics Choice Awards. Of course, Nicole Kidman knows how to wear a suit in both subversive and elevated ways: who could forget the glitzy gray Michael Kors pinstriped jumpsuit that recalled her iconic AMC ad. A look that was later auctioned off at Sotheby’s, and became a go-to Halloween costume, too. It’s in suiting that Kidman holds the power.

It’s no surprise that this year’s Critics Choice Awards, held at the Santa Monica Airport’s Barker Hangar—not far from the site of the Palisades Fire—were a relatively toned-down affair. (The E! red carpet pre-show was canceled ahead of the ceremony.) Matching the mood of the evening, many guests opted to wear darker and neutral tones—though that didn’t preclude them from dynamic fashion moments. Just take Demi Moore in navy strapless Schiaparelli, or Monica Barbaro in an ab-baring black Prada two-piece. There were plenty of colorful looks on the red carpet too, however. The Industry cast showed off high-octane looks, with leading ladies Myha’la and Marisa Abela in a sheer blue floral halter-neck and a rich maroon velvey Dior dress, respectively. (Their co-star Sagar Radia joined them in a pale pink suit.) Elsewhere on the carpet, Emilia Pérez nominee Zoe Saldaña opted for a cherry Saint Laurent, while Shōgun’s Moeka Hoshi also embraced the bold hue in Louis Vuitton. Other stars cast a wider net with their fashion, from Nicole Kidman’s structured suiting to Cynthia Erivo’s sequined peplum.

The actor and singer—who is nominated for best supporting actress for her turn in Wicked—has delivered many elegant (and Glinda-worthy) fashion moments this awards season, and her Critics Choice look on Friday night was no different. In fact, it even upped the ante. The star and her stylist, Mimi Cuttrell, chose an ethereal dress from Dior Couture that leaned into fantasy and whimsy—so much so, in fact, that it wouldn’t seem out of place in the Wicked universe. Grande’s dress—a short, collared style in tulle and crinoline, embroidered with weaves of natural raffia, organza flowers, and straw trimmings— is from Christian Dior’s spring 2025 couture collection, which was designed by Maria Grazia Chiuri and debuted in Paris just last month. Though it was not in Grande’s signature shade of Glinda pink, a hue she has been sporting on the red carpet for months now while promoting the film, the design was still fit for a princess: Its elaborate embroidery demanded some 2,500 hours of labor, to say nothing of the 1,300 hours it took to make the rest of the dress. (This is couture, after all: The beauty is in its meticulous handiwork.) Dior spring 2025 couture If this is any indication of how splendid Grande’s Oscars look will be in March, we’re all in for a big treat. With fresh-off-the-runway couture now on the table, our minds are spinning with the possibilities. Will she go for a voluminous floral Valentino frock? A fabulous shaggy-pink Schiaparelli coat?

5 Ways to Style Hotel-Like Slippers for Everyday,https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-style-hotel-slippers,"February 7, 2025",By Kerry Pieri,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Few things communicate luxury quite like a well-appointed pair of hotel slippers. Designers are bringing that energy to the everyday with inspired slippers that are created for the streets. Miu Miu arguably started the trend last fall with a logo’ed leather pair that set the tone and The Row has made the slipper one of its house codes, most often paired with louche silhouettes in neutral tones. Consider the slipper the less feminine take on last spring’s fixation on the ballerina, primed to be paired with maxi dresses and easy trousers with tanks as the weather warms up. Surprisingly versatile, you can style yours with denim for weekend wear, suiting for the office, and nearly every occasion in between. From sleek satin pairs by The Row and Loro Piana, to fur-lined Toteme slippers, and leather styles from Proenza Schouler and Bottega Veneta, the options are nearly endless—and wildly comfortable. Pair them with socks now for warmth or wear them solo come spring, simply slide into the slipper look and thank us later. Embrace the anorak trend—but make it extra elegant by pairing yours with a poplin midi and elevated accessories. A satin slipper is the ideal shoe to keep the whole thing sleek but still perfectly casual.

The trick is in adding interest through texture, proportion, and shape—like with a wool felted cape, voluminous Bermuda shorts and a cool pendant necklace.

Kendall Jenner Embraces Swaddling in Her Model-Off-Duty Style,https://www.vogue.com/article/kendall-jenner-model-off-duty-style-nyfw-fall-2025,"February 7, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"After Christopher John Rogers closed the first day of New York Fashion Week with his 8 p.m. time slot, models and attendees alike were surely pleased that today’s marquee show was called at a very reasonable 12 p.m. The return of Calvin Klein Collection drew a starry crowd—including Kendall Jenner, who walked the runway for Veronica Leoni’s inaugural collection as the likes of Bad Bunny, Kate Moss, Christy Turlington Burns, and Klein himself looked on. Then, post-show, Jenner swapped her runway look for a cozy-chic outfit featuring pieces from other titans in American fashion. Battling the chilly New York air, Jenner swaddled herself in a draped sage green cashmere top from The Row, which she wore over a midriff-baring white tee. On the bottom, she kept up her suiting in a pair of black trousers (cinched with a skinny black belt) and a pair of black loafers. Going incognito mode, she added a navy Ralph Lauren baseball cap and black rectangular shades to the mix. Kendall Jenner leaves the fall 2025 Calvin Klein Collection show in New York. With fashion week just kicking off (and fashion month on the horizon), we are constantly facing the challenge to look presentable while it’s frigid outside—and often losing that battle. But Kendall Jenner, in her effortless draped cashmere and lowkey baseball cap, is here to remind one and all that you can’t go wrong with high-low styling...or a cozy sweater.

Bad Bunny! Kate Moss! Calvin Himself! Everyone Turned Out for Calvin Klein’s NYFW Return,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/calvin-klein-nyfw-veronica-leoni,"February 7, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Grace Burns and Eve Hewson giggled, their eyes darting as a St. Barth's baseball-capped gentleman passed them on the Calvin Klein embossed sisal carpet. The gentleman was none other than Benito, also known as Bad Bunny, casually slouching towards the front row at Calvin Klein. A scrum of photographers shifted their lenses from Calvin Klein himself towards the 30-year-old pop star. Then just before the lights dimmed, FKA Twigs and boyfriend, Jordan Hemingway scooched next to him on the bench. When the show began Bad Bunny watched poker-faced as former girlfriend Kendall Jenner strutted past, bespectacled and suited in look 3. Until today, Calvin Klein, the brand, had left a gap in the New York Fashion Week schedule for almost seven years. Now, at the garment district headquarters of the brand, the whole world and their mother showed up to herald the American brand’s return under the new stewardship of creative director Veronica Leoni, the first woman to take the lead. (The last time Calvin Klein was on the schedule was with Raf Simons in September 2018.) Speaking of everyone and their mother, the aforementioned Grace Burns is the daughter of Christy Turlington, with whom she arrived, both wearing straight-from-the runway looks. Turlington greeted another old-school Calvin face, Kate Moss herself, with an extended, shimmying hug before chatting with Mario Sorrenti and his wife, Mary Frey, and stylist Elizabeth Saltzman. Actor Greta Lee also took her spot front row in floor-skimming, fog-colored satin, alongside Bridgerton star Simone Ashley, in a strapless deconstructed dress. (It was only once the show began that it became clear the front row ensembles were previews from the collection). But it was Klein, flanked by Anna Wintour and his ex-wife Kelly, who garnered the most excitement from other attendees. Klein, who sold the company and retired in 2002, offered an endorsement of Leoni by watching the show from the front row (a rarity since his retirement). After stints at Jil Sander, Phoebe Philo’s Céline, and The Row, Leoni joins Calvin—and her sensibilities that reflect the brand’s namesake. She leads with sensuality, restraint, and functionality. “For decades, Calvin Klein interpreted the idea of bold self-expression, and I am willing to empower it with a strong accent on style and creativity,” she said when first hired. As Brooke Shields' famously said, “Nothing gets between me and my Calvins,” and today, on 39th Street, that seemed to Leoni's sentiment as well.

"Kid-Tested, Vogue-Approved: Playtime With Spring’s Most Whimsical Accessories",https://www.vogue.com/article/kid-tested-vogue-approved-spring-accessories,"February 7, 2025",By Chloe Malle,"“Can you say ‘Hi, Vogue’ to the camera?” Eita, 3, looked at Lucy Dolan-Zalaznick, from Vogue’s social team, with bewilderment. “Who is Vogue? I don’t know them.” This may have been true for many of the toddler models who arrived at Studio 5 on the 24th floor of the World Trade Center last week, but within an hour of the shoot, they all knew exactly who Vogue was: an Oz-like benefactor providing toys and playspace on a chilly winter Friday. When the Vogue fashion editors returned from Europe in October, one of the resounding takeaways from the spring 2025 shows was a wide embrace of the childlike and playful, from the animal beanbag seating at Bottega Veneta (I was partial to the otter) to Coperni’s Euro Disneyland spectacular. As a parent of two toddlers who live and breathe Richard Scarry, I found Matthieu Blazy’s giant intrecciato leatherbound Biggest Word Book Ever to cause a rare moment of fashion awe. Elsewhere, Alessandro Michele gave models kitty cat purses at his first Valentino show; Moschino showcased hand-scribbled bags and shoes; and models at Coach hugged oversized leather teddy bear clutches and had toy taxi cabs affixed to their sneakers. With designers so intent on leaning into childlike whimsy, we thought: Who better to take them up on their creations than actual children? The offspring of various Vogue staffers were called to duty. Calliope, 2, is pleased with a Bottega Veneta bag. “You can’t wear that hat, can you?” photographer Jeff Henrikson challenged Henry, 2, using the oldest trick in the book. Henry quickly insisted he could indeed wear the voluminous Marni topper. With reference boards creating six scenarios, from “adventure playtime” to “dress-up tea party,” Henrikson, himself a father to two toddlers, was a deft handler of tiny people with outsize egos. Eve, 2, absolutely refused to wear anything but the Simone Rocha crocs–which were not on her board! Instead, she demanded two purses, “all the jewelry,” and “Elsa sunglasses,” which were in fact vintage Miu Miu. Henry, 2, wears a Marni hat while pondering a fruit surprise ball from Bonjour Fete. Many of these Vogue youth happen to be friends off-set: Henry and Eve, who have spent weekends together, shuffled towards each other for a cozy greeting; and Agnes, 5, gave Eita a big “hello.” Meanwhile, overwhelmed by the number of onlookers, Calliope, 2, requested a closed set and insisted on a pink or purple purse, but was forced to settle for Bottega Veneta’s hand-appliquéd Andiamo bag. And Alice, who had a hard out for her early dinner time, kept announcing it was time to go home while holding cobalt fringed Ferragamo heels to her face like a hangry Munch’s The Scream. Alice, 2, considers her own art while examining a Moschino bag. Nearing her hard out with Ferragamo shoes. Agnes took the assignment the most seriously, arriving directly from school and announcing that she was pleased with the bejeweled Simone Rocha platform crocs but had feedback about the Valentino kitty clutch: “Too heavy.” Eita also seemed to understand the gravity of the situation, removing his shoes and putting on clean socks to stand on top of Bottega Veneta’s $10,000 ladybug bean bag. He was, however, more starstruck to meet Corduroy the Bear and Lowly Worm. Grant, 6, also showed up after school and was very proud of his handstand skills, but fortunately held back while wearing Loewe’s clown brogues, with their rather dangerously elongated toe box. And Khalin, 2, arrived roaring—lion in hand—and raring to go, very glad to play with a Noah’s Ark line of Schleich animal figurines while wearing a crimson Marni hat. Happily, no one was overheard declaring that they wouldn’t leave naptime for less than $10,000. Coach shoes and animal entourage. Grant, 6, has big shoes to fill—Loewe ones. Loewe puzzle bag surrounded by its namesake. Eve, 2, asked for “all the necklaces” and draped herself in Swarovski ones. Coach backpack. Khalin, 2, surrounded by a menagerie of Schleich wild life and dinosaurs, wears a Marni hat. Eita, 3, and friends. Bottega Veneta beanbag chair.

Addison Rae’s Current Style Is One Long Audition for a Y2K Movie About a Dancer With a Dream,https://www.vogue.com/article/addison-rae-style-y2k-dancer-uniform,"February 7, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"As her stardom continues to evolve, Addison Rae has stylistically oscillated from pop diva to true character play: A Swan Lake meets Las Vegas showgirl look for the 2024 MTV VMAs, a snow-white Chloé bodysuit from Chemena Kamali’s spring 2025 collection that gave Sugar Plum Fairy, a mermaid-inspired Thom Browne look for the CFDAs. Using archival fashion and the depths of a Y2K hashtagged Depop scroll, she and her stylist Dara Allen bolster bolder and bolder looks. In the last few weeks, Addison Rae has been doing some fantasy method dressing: This time, it seems, as if she’s auditioning for an early ’00s movie about a down and out, young, beautiful dancer with a dream who, despite circumstance, never needs to outfit repeat. The “Aquamarine” singer stepped out for a meal at All Times in Studio City, California, wearing an ultra-mini pleated blue ra-ra skirt and a cropped denim jean jacket. She accessorized with blue knee-high ribbed socks, tan suede boots, and oversized white-framed sunglasses. Plus, two bouncy bouquets of flowers. Earlier in the week, Rae was also photographed in Los Feliz out for an early breakfast stop-off, wearing a black, tucked-up crop top and a similarly short-short, teal ra-ra skirt, with neon pink legwarmers, and white sneakers. The bellybutton piercing added to the ’00s dance school vibe. Rae is no stranger to the ins and outs of a dancer’s uniform: When it’s not a Chloé bodysuit for some figure skater-esque fashion, it’s an actual ballet dancer-approved Grishko leotard. These recent dual looks incorporate Rae’s more wacky sartorial leanings too: A chaotic hodge podge of nostalgic colors and shapes, with kitschy graphics and accessories. The singer is currently teasing her next release, “High Fashion.” She posted a video to her website, dancing around to Madonna’s “Inside of Me” holding up images of the visuals for the forthcoming song. So is she making a case for a Britney biopic? A Honey reboot? The chaotic pop diva wardrobe keeps us guessing.

This Tokyo Store Is a Celebrity Go-To for Rare Designer Bags,https://www.vogue.com/article/casanova-vintage-tokyo-vintage-bags-celebrities,"February 6, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Stars, they’re just like us: They love a good deal! Sure, A-listers can afford to buy a brand-new Hermès bag, but what's the fun in that? Increasingly, celebrities are tapping into the designer resale market instead, sourcing rare secondhand bags that are unique and one-of-a-kind. Everyone from Kylie Jenner to Rihanna have been spotted carrying cool vintage bags, and there’s one hotspot in Tokyo where they’re all flocking to: Meet Casanova Vintage. Owned by Ebinabe, Casanova was founded in December 2019, and has fast become a go-to destination for special handbags. It has expanded to four different stores across Tokyo, including in prime shopping neighborhoods such as Ginza and Omatosando. “Our collection is carefully curated from a mix of domestic and international vendors,” says Ebinabe of Casanova's assortment. “We have a dedicated buy-back store where customers can sell their pre-owned luxury products. This allows us to offer a unique selection of high-quality, secondhand luxury bags.” A$AP Rocky Step into one of the four Casanova hotspots, and you’re bound to find classic quilted Chanel single flaps, or pristine Hermès Birkin and Kelly bags. Its largest speciality, however, is Louis Vuitton pieces—everything from Takashi Murakami shoulder styles from the 2000s, to even more rare collaboration pieces, such as the Comme des Garçons x LV bags. It’s no wonder why celebrities have flocked to the store, then: The exclusive bags (and hefty price tags) are simply begging for some red carpet action. (Or, at the very least, a paparazzi moment.) But how did stars such as A$AP Rocky and Pharrell stumble upon the store, especially given Tokyo is a mecca for vintage? “Honestly, we’re not sure exactly when it started,” says Ebinabe of the cult celebrity following. Though, he has a few guesses. “There are many vintage stores and major retailers, but we’ve yet to see one with a style quite like ours. Casanova is more than just a shop—it’s an experience. From our one-of-a-kind selection to our approach to customer service and hospitality, we believe these elements create something special that keeps people coming back.” Pharrell Though it’s hard for Ebinabi to pick a favorite celebrity client of all time, he does have a few memorable interactions as of late. “A$AP Rocky was definitely a memorable guest,” says Ebinabe. “He has a deep appreciation for cultural fashion and picked up several unique pieces, including a rare 1996 Issey Miyake parachute bomber jacket, which he later wore in the Riot music video.” More recently, Madonna—the queen of pop, no big deal!—also popped in to shop the styles. “Madonna selected several standout pieces, especially vintage Chanel and Louis Vuitton bags from the early 2000s,” says Ebinabe. “She not only loved our collection, but also connected with the overall vibe and style of the store.” Should you find yourself in Japan, a visit to Casanova is a must. But if you're not heading to Tokyo anytime soon, worry not: Casanova also has its sights set on expanding into new markets very soon. Meaning, you'll be able to shop like a celebrity, too. “We’re excited to continue growing and have plans to expand internationally,” says Ebinabe. “Our goal is to open stores in major cities like New York, Atlanta, or Los Angeles within the next two years.” Central Cee More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

Angelina Jolie Makes the Case for a Signature Red Carpet Dress,https://www.vogue.com/article/angelina-jolie-maria-premiere-signature-red-carpet-dress,"February 6, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Cue the paparazzi! Angelina Jolie brought some major movie star energy to the Santa Barbara International Film Festival last night. The star was on hand to be honored with the Maltin Modern Master Award, adding to the praise she has received for starring as Maria Callas in the Pablo Larrain film, Maria. Throughout her press tour for the project, Jolie has been delivering one chic ensemble after the next; The fashion has been understated and elegant, whether she’s wearing a vintage gown or a sleek three-piece suit. But last night, it became clear that Jolie has cultivated a signature red carpet look, as no one does a slinky silk dress better than the A-lister. For the festival, Jolie wore a champagne-colored silky floor-length dress, paired with a draped white blazer. The dress hit all the right formal notes in a subdued way, perhaps owning to the fact that Jolie has a long history of wearing such silky designs. Her Marc Bouwer dress at the 2004 Oscars, and her Atelier Versace gown at the 2015 Critics Choice Awards, are proof that, sometimes, the best looks are the ones that make a subtle and timeless statement. With virtually every fashion house and runway look at her disposal, Jolie’s commitment to the minimalist slip dress over the years is a respectable rarity. In an overwhelming arena of different trends and aesthetics, she knows what she likes, and she sticks to it. There’s something refreshing about a red carpet star who embraces consistency—especially when the end result hits every single time. Plus, compared to the ornate gowns Maria Callas used to wear on the stage, Jolie’s streamlined looks are a nice departure from her film character. Call it anti-method dressing.

Kendrick Lamar Has Always Used Fashion to Send a Message,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/kendrick-lamar-fashion,"February 6, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Kendrick Lamar hasn’t even hit the stage at Super Bowl LIX, but he’s already riding high. On Sunday, the rapper took home five Grammys for his song “Not Like Us,” an eviscerating diss track in his protracted feud with Drake. As if Lamar’s lyrics—and the enthusiastic support from his star-studded audience—weren’t brutal enough, he used his fashion to drive the final nail in the coffin. Accepting his awards on the Grammys stage, Lamar wore a Maison Margiela Canadian tuxedo—a subtle dig at Drake’s home country. This is far from the first time Lamar has used fashion to send a message (though maybe the most creative). He’s wont to lean into iconography and pieces loaded with meaning: Repping his hometown of Compton—and Los Angeles at large—he regularly sports an LA baseball cap and Dodger blue. During his Big Steppers Tour, he painted himself as a Christlike figure, wearing a custom Tiffany & Co. crown of thorns. While Lamar has been championed by major fashion houses like Chanel and Louis Vuitton (who made his 2022 Super Bowl look), he’s also thrown his weight behind labels like Martine Rose, ERL, and Willy Chavarria. “He’s someone who understands the impact of what he’s doing, and his messaging is all very, very politically minded, and it comes from a place of sincerity and goodness,” Chavarria told Vogue in 2024. The designer, who dressed Lamar for his “Not Like Us” video and Big Steppers Tour, will team up with the rapper for a limited collection in honor of his Super Bowl halftime performance. While we wait with bated breath for Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl LIX Half-Time performance, take a look back at some of his fashion evolution.

Olivia Rodrigo Is the First Celebrity to Get Her Hands on This Viral Shoe,https://www.vogue.com/article/olivia-rodrigo-viral-louboutin-pointe-shoes,"February 6, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"When Christian Louboutin released the Cassia pump—a stiletto outfitted with a squared toe box and ribbons that lace up like a ballerina’s pointe shoe—the shoes went instantly viral. Luckily for Olivia Rodrigo, she was able to get her hands on a pair. Last we saw Rodrigo, she was wearing a sleek, strappy vintage Versace gown at the 2025 Grammys, where she was nominated for Best Song Written for Visual Media for her hit “Can’t Catch Me Now.” The singer took to Instagram, posing in a custom white minidress from Alessandra Rich, outfitted with puff sleeves, a tiered ruffle hem, and an exaggerated collar festooned with lace and bows. Think coquette meets milkmaid. But with the black pointe shoe stilettos laced up to the calf, Rodrigo spared the look from being saccharine. She leaned into the camp of it all, topping off the look with a Betty Boop-esque curl on her forehead. Rodrigo makes perfect sense to wear the shoe: she’s jetéd into ballet territory before in her “brutal” music video, which featured her as a punky dancer, dressed in fishnets and blush pink. One thing that Olivia Rodrigo does well is elevating girlish aesthetics, and her black Louboutin pointe shoes are certainly no exception.

Rihanna Runs It Back With an Old Faithful Animal Print Coat,https://www.vogue.com/article/rihanna-rewears-snake-print-coat,"February 6, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Rihanna isn’t a rewearer—the last Rih Rih repeat I can think of is when she repurposed her iconic and one-of-a-kind Saint Laurent heart-shaped jacket for a night at Nobu. But she’s pulled another memorable look from the Rihanna archive, and once again, it’s for an evening of sushi and celebrating big. The singer was pictured heading out of Nobu’s Los Angeles location for her cousin’s birthday, wearing a snakeskin Supreme trench—buttoned to the top—with faded gray jeans. It’s a jacket she was last seen wearing in 2023, on another trip out for dinner at her favorite spot, Giorgio Baldi in Santa Monica. On its first outing, a then-pregnant Rihanna wore it with an oversized Vetements inside-out hoodie—worn as a dress—a Louis Vuitton by Marc Jacobs bag, and a pair of Tom Ford Padlock sandals. Casual, the Rihanna way. Animal print, of course, is a Rihanna go-to: Whether she’s doubling up with a fuzzy, faux fur cow print bomber jacket and a Fendi ponyhair baguette bag, or archive Cavalli tiger stripes.

Mikey Madison Is Committed to This Ladylike Shoe Trend,https://www.vogue.com/article/mikey-madison-t-bar-heel-shoe,"February 6, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Mikey Madison has been nominated at every major awards ceremony of the season, emerging as one of the frontrunners—alongside Demi Moore—for best actress at the forthcoming Academy Awards. A solid Oscars campaign requires a lot of promo and appearances, with the right footwear. And Mikey Madison has a particularly elegant shoe silhouette she’s come to rely on to carry her through the season. The Anora actor was photographed yesterday (February 5) in London, where she was set to attend the BAFTAs Rising Star party to celebrate her own nomination later that evening. She wore a tailored beige Fall 2024 Burberry coat, Chanel oval sunglasses, a Ferragamo front flap crossbody, and Tiffany rings. Instead of the rough and ready combat boots the Burberry look was originally styled with on the runway, Madison chose a pair of Ferragamo T-bar pumps in patent khaki. While out in New York City at the beginning of the year, Madison paired a powdery blue Patou set with another pair of black patent Ferragamo pumps with the wraparound T-strap. The T-bar heel harks back to the ’40s and ’50s, a polite shoe silhouette worn often by Audrey Hepburn. It began to make more of an appearance in fashion again last year, and has been worn more recently by Zoe Saldaña and Ariana Grande, from Jimmy Choo and Khaite respectively. Stylist Jamie Mizrahi—who also works with the likes of Jennifer Lawrence and Riley Keogh—has helped the actor double down on a chic, feminine aesthetic. They’ve mastered movie star glamor for the film festival circuit and red carpets by way of Chanel haute couture gowns and tweet suits, velvet and silk Prada numbers, and Matthieu Blazy’s last custom Bottega Veneta dress. She’s also not afraid of playing with fashion too, with a sleek Saint Laurent suit, or pulling straight from the runway, like the red nail-studded Schiaparelli spring 2024 finale look as worn by Kendall Jenner. Madison’s jaunt to London has been full of more ladylike fashion. For the London Critics’ Circle Film Awards, she wore a bright red silk Simone Rocha gown with a halterneck that fastened with two giant bows and fell with a devilishly low back. She wore another all-red outfit for the BAFTAs Rising Star party, with Mizrahi styling Madison in archive Giorgio Armani recreated from a ’90s collection. The red blazer and matching belted dress was styled with elegant black gloves, sheer tights, and black pumps.

Justin Bieber Is My Relatable Winter Style Icon,https://www.vogue.com/article/justin-bieber-winter-style-inspiration,"February 5, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"I like to think that I know how to put a decent outfit together, but when it comes to the frigid winter months, any sense of fashion flair that I have goes out the window. Don’t get me wrong: I love pretty clothes. But the moment there is even a little nip in the air, I pretty much turn into a fashion-less blob devoid of any trendiness—layered up in my scarves, puffer coats, and many Heat-Tech layers. Admittedly, it’s hard to find joy in dressing when the cool air feels like knives jabbing into your skin. But lucky for me, I do have a new style muse who is getting me inspired to tackle winter dressing: that would be none other than Justin Bieber (a fellow Canadian, no less.) This past month, Bieber has been spotted around New York City (which is very much cold right now) wearing outfits that are cozy, yet cool in their own way. On first glance, his getups—filled with oversized hoodies and extra-baggy pants—may look like a standard outfit that all the Lower East Side bros are wearing. But lean in a little closer to notice the details, and you’ll find plenty of elevated touches. His hoodies, for one, have a deliberately oversized fit—in shades like neon green, or neutral gray. I also like how he pairs them with equally spacious trousers, including a chic pleated tanned pair from Jil Sander. Love it or loathe it, these relaxed silhouettes have been on all the runways, and Bieber happens to be right on-trend. If loving his grubby skater boy fits is wrong, I do not want to be right. I’m also inspired by how Bieber layers his looks. When piling on pieces to stay warm, it’s easy to end up looking like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, but Bieber has proven that, with the right proportions, it can work. Take the oversized stripe shirt he recently wore, which peaked out of the hem of his fuzzy zip-up bomber just right—the navy pinstripes matching his dark-wash jeans. It’s all so on point. And better yet, he looks warm! Then there are the singer's accessories. Rather than pick up your standard wool hat or snow boots, the star has kept toasty in more fashion-minded pieces like a Prada ball cap, a tiny knit blue beanie, and a pair of brown Loewe shearling house slippers. (Bieber loves a house slipper, having previously worn styles from Louis Vuitton and his own brand, Drew House.) Around his waist, he has punctuated his baggy pants with sleek leather belts, either woven or solid. Bieber is showing that it is, in fact, quite easy to complete a bundled-up outfit, and make it feel polished. So, the next time I am dreading leaving the house into the cold? Bieber will serve as my daily reminder: Slip on that belt! Change that shoe! Put in some effort! More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

"No, That’s Not a Margaux Bag Anya Taylor-Joy Is Carrying",https://www.vogue.com/article/anya-taylor-joy-faux-margaux-bag,"February 5, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Anya Taylor-Joy continued her stylish romp through New York City today, where she added an eyebrow-raising bag to her repertoire. At first glance, the enormous mahogany suede doctor bag that the actor toted looked to be an oversized Margaux bag from The Row. But in fact, it wasn’t the stealth-wealth bag dubbed a “future heirloom” by British Vogue’s Alice Cary, but something else entirely. Taylor-Joy, in fact, carried the Atlas bespoke Weekender. While it bears a striking resemblance to The Row’s It-bag, it features distinct differences: the Atlas bag lacks the buckle detail on the side panels and has longer handles that disconnect from the purse, among other distinctions. Anya Taylor-Joy in New York City. The bag is no Wirkin-style knockoff, though. It was created especially to serve as the 2025 Golden Globes gift bag vessel, where Taylor-Joy was as a presenter. (Not just anyone can walk away with the million dollar gift bag—you’ve got to earn it by presenting or taking home a trophy.) The actor, in the throes of promoting her new film The Gorge, paired the Row-adjacent bag with a Matrix-esque black leather trench coat, a turtleneck, trousers, and heeled leather boots. Chic outfit aside, our eyes are drawn straight to the gargantuan tote in the crook of Taylor-Joy’s elbow. We’re sure that the Globes’ gift bag committee is thrilled to see the bag being put to good use. Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

"Molly Ringwald, Jenna Lyons, and More Hit the Runway for Lingua Franca’s First-Ever Fashion Show",https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/lingua-franca-first-runway-show,"February 5, 2025",By Irene Kim,"“Art is the triumph over chaos” was the line written on the show notes at Lingua Franca’s first-ever runway presentation. Rachelle Hruska took over The Bowery last night—the downtown landmark which also happens to be co-owned by her husband Sean MacPherson—to stage a show, which was not only beautifully curated but also a bit unconventional and fun. Unlike a traditional runway, her cast of models included an ensemble of iconic New Yorkers including Pat Cleveland, Molly Ringwald, Jenna Lyons, and Jordan Roth, among others. “Everyone walking in the show is a friend of mine,” Hruska said, sporting a sweater embroidered with the show’s motto. “I wanted my first runway to highlight the creative downtown New Yorkers who inspire me. I wanted it to feel eclectic but cohesive, a real reflection of the spirit of this city. But most importantly I wanted it to be fun.” Her models not only sported the brand’s signature knits but also newer offerings like sharp double-breasted jackets, bohemian summer dresses, and jeans. Hruska also added an extra-touch of downtown by incorporating pieces from the tapestries and the bed sheets at the hotel into her prints. Hruska is no stranger to the limelight; she first came on the scene in the 2000s after launching the popular lifestyle and society blog Guest of a Guest. She started Lingua Franca in 2016 and soon thereafter became a point of conversation in the pop culture landscape when Connie Britton wore one of the brand’s sweaters embroidered with the line “Poverty is Sexist” at the Golden Globes. “I had no idea how much fun [doing a show] would be—I would have done it sooner. The entire process was energizing, and honestly, the best distraction from everything happening in the world right now,” Hruska said. The audience seemed to agree; there wasn’t an empty seat in the room, and even The Bowery’s lobby was jam-packed with standing guests trying to catch a glimpse of the collection. It seems this is the beginning of the nine-year-old brand’s next chapter, and we can expect to see additional runway shows from Lingua Franca in the future, as well as plenty of New Yorkers wearing more than just her cashmere knits.

Victor Glemaud Turns Up the Coziness and Color With His New Rug Collection,https://www.vogue.com/article/victor-glemaud-rugs-patterson-flynn,"February 5, 2025",By Mark Holgate,"Throughout his career, Victor Glemaud has looked at what he designs from every angle known to a fashion designer’s eye—until now, that is. When Glemaud, who made his name with curvaceous, size-inclusive, and inventively hued knitwear, started to collaborate with Patterson Flynn on a series of rugs—the company, owned by interiors brand Schumacher, is renowned for its artisanal carpets—he only had to look in one direction: Downward, to floor level. “You’re designing something that likely will be, in part, covered—whether it’s by a sofa, or a chair, or a coffee table, or whatever,” said Glemaud, who’s making his second foray into interior design with this collection; the first was textiles for Schumacher, and a chance email exchange with them led him to designing the rugs. “What I had to figure out was: How do you get a variation in pattern and color, but also convey the same kind of softness that my knits have? In the end, you don’t want the rug to look or feel flat.” Victor Glemaud’s terrific sense of color comes to the fore with this his Assine rug in azure. To be sure: Glemaud succeeds in achieving the rich dimensionality he was aiming for. If I was unrolling one of Glemaud’s Patterson Flynn rugs in my home, I wouldn’t so much as put a footstool on it. With his mix of geodes and scrolling lines, floral-edged borders, and chevron zig zagging—not to mention his color palette (terracotta, pearl gray, azure, yellow)—I’d be loath to cover any of them. And in a moment when the statement rug can sometimes feel a bit like a bank statement—a dispiriting experience because you know exactly what it’s going to say (or in this case, look like)—Glemaud’s designs have a wit and a warmth which feel zingy and original. The Cocody rug in seaglass, with graphic patterns inspired by a trip Glemaud took to Senegal. When it came to inspiration for his collection, a trip to Dakar in Senegal—where he’d been captivated by the bold graphism of the ceramics and chairs he saw—was writ large in his mind. (Several of the rugs are named after places on the Ivory Coast—Bietry and Cocody among them.) But working on the rugs was also a crash course in learning about things he wasn’t familiar with—including that certain textiles (raffia, abaca, oxidized wool) could bring emotional resonance to the textures he was looking to achieve. The rugs are made by hand, and to order, with the entire process taking several months; Glemaud wanted each piece to bear the hand of their makers. The Assine rug in camel—and Glemaud’s nephews, Winter and River. When it was time to think about photographing his designs, Glemaud knew exactly what he wanted to do—which is why one day at a townhouse in Brooklyn he was joined by his nephews Winter and River, the rugs laid out in various rooms, mixed with mid-century furniture. “I wanted to show this sense of nesting joy,” he said, “showcasing a normal experience that Black families all over the world have, but which doesn’t get shown that often: They are meant to be snapshots of joy.” Meanwhile, Glemaud is now nesting in Seoul, South Korea, after a lifetime in New York. His husband, Jacques, moved there for work, and Glemaud has settled right in. The only question, as he and his husband furnish their new place, is which of the many rugs will go where.

"Lynn’s Passage to India: A Whirlwind Three Days in Mumbai, From Vintage Markets to Golden Crocodile Jewelry",https://www.vogue.com/article/lynn-yaeger-mumbai-sabyasachi-travel-diary,"February 5, 2025",By Lynn Yaeger,"I arrive in Mumbai from Paris at 1 a.m. I have never been to India before, and I am quickly overwhelmed by the airport—neon-lit! teeming with people!—but no matter. I am traveling with my guardian angel, Mr. Mickey Boardman, who has been to Mumbai, he shrugs, maybe 35 times, and is hardly intimidated by this barely controlled chaos. When he first came here, Mickey tells me, he stepped out of the airport and thought, I am home. He is in India so often not just because he loves it, but because he works with Citta, a nonprofit organization that builds schools and hospitals in India; I am here because the designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee has invited us—and what seems like a few thousand other people—to celebrate the 25th anniversary of his brand. Sabyasachi, it turns out, is sort of the Ralph Lauren of India, if that designer made over-the-top wedding ensembles and high jewelry that drips and dangles with monumental stones. Sabyasachi’s gala fashion show is set for the next night, which means that this flying visit gives us approximately 72 hours to see a town of 233 square miles and 21 million people. Then again, Mr. Mickey is the perfect guide for a maiden voyage to Mumbai, which by the way, everyone here calls Bombay. We are staying at the Taj Mahal Palace, a stupendous Victorian pile just across from the Gateway to India, a monumental arch on the Arabian Sea that was built in 1924. (Dior held a show here in 2023.) We stare at it every time we leave the hotel—tight security—lots of purse scanning—but never actually venture across the highway. Instead, on our first morning, we walk a few blocks to Colaba Causeway, which could be dubbed the 34th Street of Mumbai, or maybe the Orchard Street of yore. We are accosted by vendors offering all manner of floppy casual clothes in beautiful Indian cotton prints, and I actually like this stuff, but am quickly overwhelmed by the crush and the heat, so I buy nothing. But I have other plans. We repair for a coffee at the Leopold Cafe, a famous hangout founded in 1871, which means it once served the Brits who ruled here. A text arrives from F, another journalist on the trip, saying that he is getting tons of clothes custom-made—Comme des Garcons shirts copied! Silk PJs with piping!—and it’s all being whipped up overnight and will be delivered to the hotel the next day. In a froth, I run back to the Taj—no mean feat in the 90-degree weather—grab two black smocks, and meet F at this tailor shop. Though they can apparently make an entire three-piece suit with a satin lining in 48 hours, they are defeated by these dresses, saying I would have to leave the frocks, and it will take a week. (Later, a friend who works in the couture in Paris will explain that the issue is the flou versus the tailleur: The former refers to ribbons and ruffles; the latter to the strict tailoring these guys are used to.) Oh well, okay, no dresses. What about jewelry? The rest of the press corps is heading to Gem Palace, but I think I know better. On the internet, I see reviews of a place called Zaveri Bazaar in Kalbadevi and we set out to find this hidden treasure. Long story short: this might be the name of the whole district. Or it might not exist. The driver leaves us off on a road that is teeming with street life: men with huge baskets of strawberries balanced on their heads, hand trucks so laden with bundles it takes two to propel. It feels safe, even though we are clearly strangers. We don’t see any jewelry. We are hopelessly lost. It dawns on us that the driver, who is game but doesn’t speak a word of English, will never find us. We walk to a main street where I see my one and only cow of the trip. At least she seems to know where she is going. But there are small miracles everywhere. An Uber actually finds us, and we head back to a group dinner, where everyone is bragging about their custom-made clothes and the jewelry they got a Gem Palace—cabochon necklaces, little diamond brooches. I grin and bear it. Let others explore the fish market at dawn, the hotel spa. Mickey texts his friend Kshitij Kankaria, founder of Dirty magazine, and clearly a major player in this town, and he says, “Come straight to Bandra! We’ll go shopping!” Bandra is kind of the Williamsburg or Tribeca of Mumbai—a neighborhood where film stars live, the sort of place where you can easily find a chai latte. We embark on a whirlwind tour via tut-tut, those terrifying affairs that are sort of like New York City pedicabs without the year-round Christmas lights. I hold on for dear life. We visit a shop which is literally called The Shop, where I make my first purchase, a big printed duffle for around $29. Down an alleyway that no one in her right mind could find is Beg Borrow Steal Studio, a charming multi-room second-hand shop with reworked vintage clothes, beaded purses, and, alas for me, a large wooden doll that looks like a mannequin and probably dates from the time Victoria presided over these parts. The doll is not cheap, but then again, she does fit handily in the newly acquired duffel. At a boutique called Two Extra Lives, Kshitij does something that is quite common here—he rents a pair of pointy, rubbery boots by Y/Project to wear to the gala that night. Where does the time go? On the way back to the hotel we pass what looks like a multi-story apartment building, but no, Mickey tells me, one family lives here. The 27-storey mansion reportedly cost an estimated one to two billion and is 570 feet tall. It allegedly offers panoramic views of the city, but no doubt you are too high up to see the details of the streets. Dressed to the nines, we head to the Jio World Convention Centre, which Sabyasachi has transformed into a huge aerie replete with fake elephant statues, abundant foliage, and a mile-long buffet. Mickey knows everybody—the real housewives of Mumbai, feminists who work with his charity, sundry hot guys who are strewn in his path. Every other woman is carrying one of Sabyasachi’s bags embellished with his trademark tiger, and nearly everyone is dressed in stunning if somber hues, since the invitation instructed “Strictly Black.” Showtime! We are ushered into a huge room that is decorated to resemble a residential square in Calcutta, with laundry hanging over the balustrades. (One look at this audience and I know their own hands have never touched soiled linen.) The Indian movie star Deepika Padukone opens the show. If I was expecting the elaborate evening ensembles Sabyasachi is famous for, I was mistaken—most of the fashions are surprisingly sportif. But wait: Here come the coats! Heavily embellished and colored like stained glass, they provide a spectacular counterpoint to the more casual offerings. Christy Turlington, looking serene in gray cashmere trousers, and with a surfeit of bling lighting up her turtleneck, closes the show. Deepika Padukone, Sabyasachi Mukherjee, and Christy Turlington during the finale of the Sabyasachi show in Mumbai. It is Republic Day, which means that the streets are even more jam-packed than usual, and many places are closed. But the Sabyasachi flagship is open. This imposing emporium displays everything from lavish sequined satchels to exquisite fine jewelry to, of course, fashions, including those heart-throb coats. I perch on a velvet settee as the designer holds forth: he explains the deliberate exclusion of those wedding ensembles from the show last night was because “Indian women want to be modern now.” He says that they would rather invest their money in say, a new business, than waste it all on a nuptial blow-out. I ask him if he insisted on the black dress code to show off his stupendous jewels and he confesses yes, that was kind of the idea. I make my way to the high jewelry floor and though I don’t usually flirt with things I can’t have, I melt at the sight of a lariat that combines turquoise, coral, and diamonds, and that even incorporates an 18-karat gold crocodile—he’s cute! I slip this over my head, and suddenly realize, I need this! How amazing would it look bouncing under a stained-glass coat, a tiger bag slung over my arm, sashaying down Canal Street, just in time for New York Fashion Week?

Vogue’s Guide to the Black-Tie Dress Code,https://www.vogue.com/article/black-tie-dress-code,"February 5, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Perhaps you’ve found yourself the recipient of an invitation with a black-tie dress code. Maybe it’s a wedding, a gala, or another equally formal event. At a time when our day-to-day attire tends toward the casual, a black-tie dress code can feel daunting, leaving people to wonder if what they already have in their closets will cut it. You never want to feel like the person who missed the memo. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Here, Vogue helps to decode the black-tie dress code. For anyone who wants to go the suiting route, the brief is pretty simple (and literal): you’re to wear a black bow tie with your dinner jacket. Because it’s a step down in fanciness from white tie, the black-tie dress code leaves more room for interpretation when it comes to garments beyond the suit. Still, there are still certain parameters. While one woman’s “dress to impress” may mean a barely-there Mugler minidress, that would be entirely wrong for a charity gala (though definitely impressive!). So, in moments of doubt, don’t be afraid to ask your host for clarification on the level of formality they are expecting of their guests. Nowadays, especially for weddings, hosts will even send out visual examples or moodboards to mitigate any misinterpretations. But when in doubt, ask the host what they are planning to wear. For women, we can generally assume that “black tie” equals “long.” But that doesn’t mean just any long dress fits the bill. Make sure your dress is rendered in an evening-appropriate fabric: think velvet, chiffon, silk, or lace. While a cocktail dress—shorter, possibly ritzier—might cut it if your host is more relaxed, it’s best to assume that a floor-sweeping number (or the aforementioned tuxedo situation) is expected. Consider the context clues. If your invitation came on thick card stock, complete with a wax seal and an address in ornate calligraphy, the dress code will likely be just as formal. But if your memo arrives digitally—via text or something like Partiful—you can take a breath. The exception there is Paperless Post: just because the invite came in via email doesn’t mean it isn’t a floor-length affair. Make sure to give the invitation a close read to get a better idea of what’s expected of you. If applicable, quiz people from your own social circle about their interpretations of the dress code. (And before you worry: No, rewearing something you already own is not a faux pas. It just shows that you’re a self-assured shopper with a good grasp on your personal style! Don’t break the bank by wearing something brand-new for every occasion.) You don’t want to turn up wearing the same dress as someone else. Consider starting a text or email thread with everyone you know going to make sure there is no overlap. But, hey—things happen. If you end up accidentally matching with another guest anyway, embrace it, and acknowledge your doppelgänger. Maybe even pose together for a quick Instagram Story! While you’ll want to stick with the formal dress code, be aware of your environment. If you can, scope out the location ahead of time: will you be navigating gravel, paving, lawn, or a parquet floor? Assess the routes you might need to take over the course of the evening, and be prepared to park the stilettos. Or, if you simply must wear your teetering Jimmy Choos, find a willing squire to ferry you across danger zones. And, on that note: Never, ever take your shoes off on the dance floor. You may step on a rogue shard of glass—or another guest may step on your pedicure. And nothing kills the party spirit like a trip to the ER for stitches or a tetanus shot. Absolutely! There’s a reason everyone else is wearing it. Just make sure your accessories are elevated—your host will appreciate the effort you’ve made, and you’ll stand out from the sea of like minds. If all else fails, buy a cluster of diamanté brooches and pile them onto lapels and necklines—or in messy, bed-head hair. Tell everyone they’re heirlooms! Take the advice given, above, but also use your discretion. Not every black-tie event is the same, so the rules may vary, but the important thing is always to respect the host and follow their vision for the night’s dress code. Black-tie events can pose an unnerving sartorial challenge, but once you’ve done one, you know how to tick the boxes while also feeling like yourself. Whether it’s a simple frock or standout gown, don’t be afraid to repeat outfits; it’s chic to look the part, but even chicer to do so in a responsible way. (Even royals and celebrities can be spotted wearing outfits they were papped in before.) Whether you achieve that by arranging your wardrobe by season or by degree of formality, build your own black-tie capsule wardrobe and you’re set.

Meghan Markle’s Earth Mom Wardrobe Has a Common Theme,https://www.vogue.com/article/meghan-markle-earth-mom-personalized-sweater-jewelry,"February 5, 2025",By Olivia Allen,"Meghan Markle’s style has always leaned towards laidback luxe—think camel tones and cashmere—but her off-duty wardrobe has taken on a more sentimental twist. From personalized knitwear to monogrammed accessories, the Duchess of Sussex has fully embraced the “Earth Mom” aesthetic, combining comfort with personal flourishes that do all the storytelling in the little details. Recently, Meghan Markle debuted a personalised sweatshirt embroidered with the names of her children, Archie and Lilibet, on Instagram, putting her own spin on mom-core. She’s also partial to initial jewellery and is known for layering delicate gold necklaces featuring the letters “M” and “H” as a romantic nod to her husband, Prince Harry. Adding to her growing collection of personalized pieces? Her Logan Hollowell constellation necklace, dedicated to her children’s star signs—because if there’s one thing Meghan does well, it’s commitment to a theme. Meghan wears a sweatshirt embroidered with the names of her children, Archie and Lilibet. Her love of personalization doesn’t stop at jewelry. Extending this approach throughout her wardrobe, she carries a Dior Book Tote embroidered with ‘Meghan’ across the front—tapping into the personalization trend we’ve seen of late when it comes to bags…Looking at you Mrs. Bieber. When With Love, Meghan finally airs in March—after it was pushed back due to the ongoing devastation of the LA wildfires—we’ll likely get even more of a glimpse into these super personal wardrobe items and interiors. All given that it’s a show that’s spun as a practical and candid how-to with Markle and her friends, new and old, sharing personal tips and tricks. While her style has evolved from royal uniform to Montecito mom, certain elements remain constant, from neutral tones to cosy knits. Only now, those pieces are stitched, stamped, and embroidered, because there’s more than one way to put a personal spin on wardrobe staples. Kate Middleton’s Wardrobe Spoke Volumes.

Hailey and Justin Bieber Remind Us of Their Couple Style Codes,https://www.vogue.com/article/hailey-justin-bieber-couple-style-date-night,"February 5, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Hailey and Justin Bieber have a shared fashion formula: In that, they do the polar opposite of what the other one does. Photographed heading out for dinner in New York, Hailey and Justin Bieber kept up their oscillating stylistic spectrum. The couple, who welcomed their first child named Jack Blues in August last year, tend to keep date night as and when. It seems like they’ve had some time to spare while in NYC this week, stepping out once again sans Jack Blues for dinner at Corner Store in Soho. The Biebers’ winter fashion M.O. has seen Hailey in oversize and waist-nipped silhouettes, sumptuous faux furs, and leather everything, while Justin has stayed cozy in all-encompassing hoodies and capacious pants. For this evening, Hailey wore a sleek monochromatic leather look, featuring a black bomber that cinched at the waist, sheer tights, and black pumps. Justin wore a gray wool coat with a cropped beige trench layer, and a gray hoodie. Both kept their sunglasses firmly on, and Hailey also toted her Rhode Lip Case in Espresso and a Peptide Lip Tint in Raspberry Jelly. The previous day, the couple were also spotted on a dinner date, and the Rhode founder debuted a fun new hairdo in the form of undulating curls. This time, she had a go at this season’s twisty, messy bun. Justin, of course, kept the black beanie that hasn’t left his head since touching down in NY on top. It might have been another case of fits that ask, ‘Are you sure you’re both attending the same function?’, but the couple jointly played with proportions, a sartorial detail that they always manage to find the threads of together.

Is Demi Moore’s Best Accessory Her Schiaparelli Bag or Her Dog?,https://www.vogue.com/article/demi-moore-accessorizes-pilaf-dog-bag,"February 5, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"The road to what could be Demi Moore’s first Academy Award has been delightful to watch: She’s turned out in gilded and golden looks that method dress for the statuette we all know she deserves, and gave a rousing speech for the ages at the Golden Globes. Through her awards season campaign, fashion has been key to the megastar storytelling. But now, it’s in her accessories that Demi Moore is pulling out all the stops. Stepping out for her appearance on Jimmy Kimmel, The Substance actor was photographed in a black Schiaparelli halterneck dress, fastened with an ornate gold cuff at the neck that’s typical of the house codes. She also wore black mules, and a long black coat with gold threading and a bright pink lining for a fun pop of color. All quite restrained and chic. Then, her accessories: Her XL oval sunglasses and chunky gold detailed drop earrings. But it was with what she toted on one arm that she really went to bat: A black and gold Schiaparelli bag, with its signature anatomical jewels that form a trompe l’oeil face, and Pilaf, Moore’s dog at previous Dogue cover star. “I think she looks like a cross between a goldfish and Bette Davis,” Moore previous told Vogue of the chihuahua—and we still see it. Moore is a longtime accessories pro—for Couture Week in Paris, she wore a stacked, layered black beaded necklace, with a pop of cherry red on her nails to match her red-bottomed shoes. It’s all in the details, even with your canines! Pilar, it seems, is a willing pawn. While we don’t know yet whether Moore and stylist Brad Goreski will look to Daniel Roseberry or Giorgio Armani for her Oscars gown, surely Pilaf will have to be present for Moore’s Academy Awards moment?

Give A Frock Los Angeles Wants You to Shop Celebrity Closets for a Cause,https://www.vogue.com/article/give-a-frock-los-angeles-benefit-auction,"February 4, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"When wildfires ravaged the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Altadena and the Palisades, Lindsey Hartman and and Makena Andros were among the many fashion professionals moved to help. So they posted a call to action on Instagram, asking for other stylists to help. “I immediately thought about all of the irreplaceable pieces we collect in our lives and how heartwrenching that loss must be,” Hartman says. The response was overwhelming. What started as a clothing drive became a Give A Frock benefit concert and auction, hosted by John C. Reilly in partnership with Julien’s Auctions. On Wednesday at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles, the Give A Frock fire aid benefit and charity concert will offer people the chance to bid on their favorite artists’ red carpet looks and tour pieces, alike. The event will benefit Altadena Girls, One Voice, Friends In Deed, and The Pasadena Humane Society. “Things really got going when I connected with my close-knit community of stylists—particularly my mentor and close friend, Shirley Kurata, as well as Kat Typaldos, Chris Horan, Tabitha Sanchez, Genesis Webb, Jordan Grossman, Amber Simiriglia, and Johnny Valencia,” she says. Chappell Roan’s costume, pictured above, donated by Genesis Webb. Sabrina Carpenter’s Alaïa dress from the “Please Please Please” music video. The result? Multiple looks from Charli xcx’s brat tour, a sequined Rodarte dress that Olivia Rodrigo chose for the premiere of The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, and the hooded blue velvet Alaïa dress Sabrina Carpenter wore for the “Please Please Please” music video. Hartman, who styles Hayley Williams, will also include one of the Paramore singer’s looks from her opening slot on the Eras Tour. (While the auction also boasts looks from Pamela Anderson, Kathleen Hanna, and Cyndi Lauper, Hartman admits she has a favorite among the lots. “It’s gotta be the three custom Beastie Boys Adidas tracksuits,” she says. “If those go missing it definitely was NOT me.”) Pamela Anderson’s Vivienne Westwood dress will also be up for grabs. Hartman also encourages attendees to bring donations to the show, partnering with LA-based upcycling sewing and production shop SUAY. “SUAY has stepped up to the plate to take overflow of clothing donations rejected by other L.A. facilities during this time and re-distribute, recycle, and ultimately reduce harmful climate impact,” she says. The fires, as the past several weeks have more than demonstrated, caused a massive swell of community care and mutual aid. Hartman hopes that the Give A Frock benefit will be no different. “Money and possessions aside, after talking to so many people affected by the fires I realized that something everyone could use right now was a really fucking good time,” she says. “And on February 5, we can promise that at the very least.” Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

The Naked Truth About Bianca Censori’s Grammys Look,https://www.vogue.com/article/the-naked-truth-about-bianca-censoris-grammys-look-2025,"February 4, 2025",By Raven Smith,"Where do we start with Bianca Censori, the Australian model, “head of architecture” at Yeezy, wife of Kanye West, and near-naked woman on the Grammys red carpet? On Sunday, Bianca stepped out in a black fur coat—so far, so fashion—which she soon dropped to reveal a slip so sheer, so without undergarments, that it exposed her uncensored nudity beneath. Kanye, on the other hand, wore a black T-shirt and trousers. Days later, the questions we’re all asking in the wake of the look circle around Bianca’s sense of autonomy, her sense of liberation, her feminism, our feminism, and her level of complicity in the way she’s showing up on the world stage. Though she’s apparently brimming with body confidence—see Bianca in a nude bodysuit, clutching a hotel pillow over her chest in Florence; see Bianca wearing a transparent Blade Runner-ish raincoat with nothing underneath—her relationship with Ye, both romantic and image-architectural, has been criticized online as perhaps overly-influential, potentially verging on controlling. There are concerns about this particular woman’s silence: We’ve heard very little from Bianca during her Kanye tenure, a remarkably different situation from his relationships with the endlessly quotable uncut gem Julia Fox and his reality powerhouse ex-wife, Kim Kardashian. Most of the women at the Grammys—in a year that felt overwhelmingly celebratory of female excellence—were there for their talent, for their loud-and-clear achievements over the past year. That said, the entire red-carpet mechanism sits on the surface level: We observe the looks—a carousel of perfect snapshots—and make our assessment about whether the dresses work. (Differences of opinion are part of the fun.) Deep-rooted, deeply old-fashioned standards for how women should act in order to appear “decent,” and in turn desirable (to men, to other women), have cast a long shadow on this practice. We’re all drawing our own lines in the sand as to what constitutes too much for a woman to show: what’s cheap, what’s tarty, what’s slutty. At its best, fashion, for me, has always celebrated a body’s sensuality rather than the unimaginative, base-level provocation of a woman’s nakedness. But I have this sinking feeling that Bianca’s dress wasn’t meant to continue a fashion dialogue with other women—that it was purely meant to provoke. Though I’m not convinced our judgements on the opaquer, less-naked dresses on red carpets reflect our best selves, they do consider our understanding of the woman in the dress, or at least her media image. It just feels icky to know so little about Bianca. While she appears to have a sense of humour (I found the hotel pillows quite funny), all I really know about her is that she has a penchant for revealing garments. While I’m not necessarily advocating for snatch on the red carpet, it could also be argued that it’s Bianca’s body, and therefore Bianca’s choice. I hate to state the obvious, but a woman can wear whatever she wants. A woman can wear as many sheer bodysuits and thongs as she likes. A woman can court the male gaze. A woman can make a zillion choices we wouldn’t personally make ourselves and still not have that mean she’s being coerced, that she’s a victim of an overbearing force, that something predatory has happened. I don’t think we should assume that because Bianca’s pretty much naked, she’s not fully in control of herself, or that she’s not thoroughly enjoying her exhibitionism. We can’t jump to a conclusion just because seeing her virtually in the nude doesn’t feel good. Because Bianca isn’t speaking up, because we’re bereft of any deeper motivations (or personality), the silence has us scrabbling for answers of our own. But maybe that’s exactly what Bianca wanted.

Anya Taylor-Joy Peacocks Around New York City,https://www.vogue.com/article/anya-taylor-joy-peacocks-around-new-york-city,"February 4, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"We’re still a few days out from New York Fashion Week, but Anya Taylor-Joy just set the bar. Doing press for her upcoming film The Gorge, the actor peacocked about in a show-stopping coat the same color as her icy blonde hair. Taylor-Joy’s outrageously fluffy shearling coat hails from Seán McGirr’s fall 2024 collection for Alexander McQueen (his first for the house)—and fetches a pretty penny at $13,000. Appropriately named the “exploding shearling coat,” the jacket’s mini hemline and extreme lapels were reminiscent of a majestic cockatoo. Taylor-Joy opted for an elongated line, pairing the thigh-grazing coatdress with a pair of nude pointy-toe pumps. Anya Taylor-Joy in New York Alexander McQueen fall 2024 Later in the day, Taylor-Joy changed into something a bit more mobile. In a concerted effort to revive the skirt suit among the younger generation (joining the ranks of Mikey Madison and Lily-Rose Depp), she wore two sets. The first was a houndstooth plaid two-piece with a miniskirt and a ladylike button-up jacket, which she paired with black knee-high boots. Sticking to the same formula, she swapped her houndstooth set for a mod Celine moment in a gray wool skirt suit with contrasting white pockets and trim, which she coordinated with white knee-high boots. As if there’s not enough to love about Anya Taylor-Joy, we appreciate that the actor is game for a major fashion risk. In her voluminous McQueen coat, she more than met the moment.

Everything You Need to Know About the 2025 Met Gala,https://www.vogue.com/article/everything-to-know-met-gala,"February 4, 2025",By Vogue,"The 2025 Met Gala is officially only a few months away! Read on for everything you need to know about fashon’s biggest night—from the date to the theme, co-hosts, and this year’s dress code. The Met Gala is a charity event and fundraiser for The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. It has traditionally been timed to mark the opening of the department’s annual fashion exhibition. Year after year, the event raises eight-figure sums. The 2025 Met Gala will take place on Monday, May 5. On Wednesday, October 9, the Metropolitan Museum of Art announced the Costume Institute’s spring 2025 exhibition, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” Drawing inspiration from Monica L. Miller’s 2009 book Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity, the exhibition is organized into 12 sections, each representing a characteristic that defines dandy style: Ownership, Presence, Distinction, Disguise, Freedom, Champion, Respectability, Jook (defined in Zora Neale Hurston’s “Characteristics of Negro Expression”—an important reference for the exhibiton—as a space for dancing, drinking, and other leisure activities), Heritage, Beauty, Cool, and Cosmopolitanism. “Superfine” will feature garments, paintings, photographs, and more from artists including Torkwase Dyson, Tanda Francis, André Grenard Matswa, and Tyler Mitchell—all exploring the indelible style of Black dandies, from the 18th century through to the present day. (Miller will also serve as a guest curator for the show, working alongside Costume Institute Curator in Charge Andrew Bolton.) Colman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, A$AP Rocky, Pharrell Williams, and Anna Wintour will co-chair the 2025 Met Gala, with LeBron James serving as an honorary chair. Reviving a tradition from years past, the 2025 Met Gala will also have a host committee, made up of André 3000, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Jordan Casteel, Dapper Dan, Doechii, Ayo Edebiri, Edward Enninful, Jeremy O. Harris, Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, Rashid Johnson, Spike Lee and Tonya Lewis Lee, Audra McDonald, Janelle Monáe, Jeremy Pope, Angel Reese, Sha'Carri Richardson, Tyla, Usher, and Kara Walker. This just in: the Met Gala 2025 dress code is “Tailored for You,” a nod to the exhibition’s focus on menswear and suiting that’s sure to bring out the sartorial creativity of this year’s attendees. That’s kept largely under wraps; guests must abide by a no-phone (and, therefore, no social media) policy once they’ve entered the museum. But the run-of-show involves dinner—overseen this year by chef Kwame Onwuachi, of the restaurants Tatiana in Lincoln Center and Dōgon in Washington, DC—and a high-profile performer (or two). Attendees also always have a moment to explore the exhibition. See exclusive photos from inside the 2024 Met Gala here, and catch a glimpse of the table settings, menu, and decor last year here. The Met Gala takes place at The Metropolitan Museum of Art each year. Guests from out of town (and even some based in the city) typically stay at hotels nearby, congregating at a few celebrity-favorite spots. In 2023, the Mark Hotel was a prime location for star-spotting; see our photos from inside its halls. The event usually hosts about 450 attendees, welcoming stars, young creatives, and paragons from the worlds of fashion, the arts, sports, and politics.

The 2025 Met Gala Has a Dress Code—and It’s Personal,https://www.vogue.com/article/met-gala-dress-code-2025,"February 4, 2025",By Leah Faye Cooper,"When guests arrive at the 2025 Met Gala for “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style”—the spring 2025 exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute—they’ll do so having considered the dress code, announced today as Tailored for You. Per The Met, the dress code is a nod to the exhibition’s focus on menswear and is “purposefully designed to provide guidance and invite creative interpretation.” “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” will explore the role of sartorial style in forming Black identities, focusing on the emergence, significance, and proliferation of the Black dandy. Composed of clothing, photographs, fine art, historical texts, and artifacts, it’s the first Costume Institute exhibition to focus on menswear since 2003’s “Men in Skirts” and was inspired by guest curator Monica L. Miller’s 2009 book, Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity. “Dandyism can seem frivolous, but it often poses a challenge to or a transcendence of social and cultural hierarchies,” Miller said in today’s statement. “It asks questions about identity, representation, and mobility in relation to race, class, gender, sexuality, and power. This exhibition explores dandyism as both a pronouncement and a provocation.” The show also reflects The Met’s ongoing commitment to authentically diversifying its exhibitions. “What makes it possible to translate Monica’s book Slaves to Fashion into an exhibition,” said Costume Institute curator in charge Andrew Bolton, “is our collection of high-style menswear, which serves as a foundation for imagining and realizing a sartorial history of Black dandyism.” André Leon Talley 5th Avenue, Arthur Elgort (American, born 1940), 1986; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, The Irene Lewisohn Costume Reference Library Suit, Morty Sills (American, active mid-to-late 19th century), 1986; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, Alfred Z. Solomon-Janet A. Sloane Endowment Fund, 2023 (2023.784a–c). Photo © Tyler Mitchell 2025 Now, about the dress code: Tailored for You can be interpreted in a myriad of ways, but it mostly means embracing looks reflective of one’s personal style. We can surely expect inspired takes on suiting—from versions of the zoot silhouette popularized by jazz musicians in the 1940s to the bold, colorful styles worn by Congolese sapeurs—though other menswear staples, such as hats, ties, canes, brooches, and pocket squares, are likely to have a strong showing too. Indeed, attendees might look to Met Gala co-chairs Colman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, A$AP Rocky, and Pharrell Williams—along with honorary chair LeBron James—for inspiration. Think Domingo arriving at the 2024 Critics Choice Awards in a mustard yellow Valentino suit and textured gold coat or Hamilton en route to the Miami Grand Prix paddock in a diamanté tank top and sleek black shades. We’ve also seen Rocky adorn his braided hair with silk scarves and beaded clips; Williams don Billionaire Boys Club graphic tees and Louis Vuitton leather flares of his own design; and James wear custom Thom Browne during the 2018 NBA Finals. “T.G.B.J.” ensemble, Tremaine Emory (American, born 1981) for Denim Tears (American, founded 2019), 2024; Courtesy Denim Tears. Photo © Tyler Mitchell 2025 Though much of the guest list will remain under wraps, the Met Gala host committee was also announced today. This group—typically composed of personalities across art, film, literature, music, sports, and more—includes André 3000, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Grace Wales Bonner, Simone Biles and Jonathan Owens, Jordan Casteel, Dapper Dan, Doechii, Ayo Edebiri, Edward Enninful, Jeremy O. Harris, Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, Rashid Johnson, Regina King, Spike Lee and Tonya Lewis Lee, Audra McDonald, Janelle Monáe, Jeremy Pope, Angel Reese, Sha’Carri Richardson, Olivier Rousteing, Tyla, Usher, and Kara Walker. They’ll be among attendees seated for a dinner prepared by chef Kwame Onwuachi, amid decor by Cy Gavin, Derek McLane, and Raúl Àvila. On view at The Met from May 10 through October 26, 2025, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” will feature 12 sections, each representing defining characteristics of the dandy aesthetic: Ownership, Presence, Distinction, Disguise, Freedom, Champion, Respectability, Jook, Heritage, Beauty, Cool, and Cosmopolitanism. Among artists bringing the exhibition to life are Torkwase Dyson, Tanda Francis, and Tyler Mitchell, as well as Iké Udé, who will serve as special consultant.

Du Bois; works by Zora Neale Hurston and Nikki Giovanni; archival issues of Jet magazine—and of course, lots of fashion: pieces worn by Frederick Douglass and Harlem Renaissance–era performers, suiting from the wardrobe of André Leon Talley, and designs by Virgil Abloh, Dapper Dan, Foday Dumbuya, and more. Prior to the May opening, The Met will host a series of exhibition-related talks and programs for all ages, both at the museum and various institutions across New York City, including the Apollo Theater. Whether guests draw inspiration from cultural giants in the exhibition, the stylish co-chairs and host committee members, or distinguished gentlemen in their own lives—fathers, grandfathers, uncles—we will be waiting with anticipation to see what guests wear to the 2025 Met Gala and, of course, look forward to celebrating the inimitable Black dandy.

2025 Just Got Even Better for GloRilla,https://www.vogue.com/article/glorilla-fenty,"February 4, 2025",By Leah Faye Cooper,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. You’ve likely seen the video: Dressed in a black tee, nude tights, and oversized burgundy sunglasses, Rihanna emphatically raps along to GloRilla’s “TGIF,” positioned inside a hotel room door frame. Does A$AP Rocky’s look of bewilderment keep Rih from belting, “It’s 7 p.m. Friday, it’s ninety-five degrees!” with the utmost enthusiasm? No. Do her stiletto heels prevent her from dropping it low when she reaches mid verse? Absolutely not; a GloRilla hit will have that effect on you. The July 2024 video served as proof that Rihanna is just like us: a big GloRilla fan. So much so that when it came time to pick a face for her Fenty empire—the first that would represent the brand across Fenty Beauty, Hair, Skin and Savage x Fenty—the Memphis-born rapper was the obvious choice. “I want to say I was at home in my car,” GloRilla tells Vogue of learning that she’d be the newest Fenty ambassador, “and I was so excited about it.” Home for the star is currently Atlanta, but when we speak, it’s the Saturday before the 2025 Grammys, and the tattooed rapper with a singular southern accent is in L.A. rehearsing for a performance at Battle of the Bands. Though versions of the HBCU marching band competition have taken place in Tennessee, “I never went to one, actually,” Glo says, “and I always wanted to.” Now, she’s as much of a draw as the bands themselves (if not more), a two-time Grammy nominee, and the face of all things Fenty. Here, GloRilla talks about the whirlwind of fame, her love of Rihanna, wearing Savage x Fenty, and more—exclusively with Vogue. Vogue: You’re a noted Rihanna fan and now the face of Fenty. Tell us about your earliest Rihanna memory. Glorilla: first song I heard from her was “Umbrella,” and I just fell in love with her. My mom used to always say that I looked like her, and when I went places people would tell me that. I loved it, and I loved her music. How are you enjoying life in Atlanta? It's good. It's like an upgraded version of Memphis—a more resourceful version. And when I want to go home, it’s just six hours to drive. You drive home? I ride home. I don't drive, I got a driver. Nice. So prior to shooting your Fenty campaign, did you use any Fenty Beauty products or wear any Savage x Fenty? I love Fenty lip gloss—the one in the square tube. It may be in my purse right now. And my makeup artist uses a highlighter on me that I love. It makes my face so shimmery. And I don't like soft baby hairs, I like the gelled down baby hair look, so I've been using the edge control. Speaking of hair, tell us about your hair journey. How did you wear your hair growing up? My momma did my hair for the most part until I got into high school. She was still doing the little clips and stuff when I was in middle school, and I used to hate it. I was too grown to be wearing my hair like that! I was like, “this is a five-year old’s hairstyle.” When I got 14, 15, I started letting real hairstylists do my hair, and I started with the weaves and everything. Did you perm your hair when you were younger? Uh huh. My momma permed my hair when I was like four years old. And do you still perm your hair today? No, I've been natural for two years now, since October 2022. What has that adjustment been like for you? I went natural years ago and it was a challenge. Well I'm 1000 percent tender-headed, so I hate getting my hair braided. I keep my braids in for months at a time because I be crying when I get my hair done. I don't do nothing with my real hair but keep it underneath wigs. I think I know the answer to this, but what’s your favorite way to wear your hair? I wear a side part, for the most part. I like black, and I do blonde sometimes. Right. You went with black hair for your Fenty campaign shoot. What was that shoot like? It was a good day. I like shooting when I look real cute in everything I have on. I don't like photo shoots where I have to look a certain type of way and I can't pick what I want to do. But I was comfortable in everything I was putting on, so it was a good shoot. Did you have a favorite look? I liked all of them. I'm real thick so I looked good in everything. And I'm comfortable with my body now because I've been in the gym. Everything fit me perfect. Thinking back to that video of Rihanna dancing to 'TGIF,"" what was your reaction? I was just screaming. I was like, “Oh my God.” I had just dropped the song and I was going to perform it at the BET Awards, and I was at rehearsals. I sat down to take a break, hopped on Instagram, and that’s the first thing I saw. I couldn't believe it. I just screamed. I was like, “Ya’ll, Rihanna just posted me!” Tell us, when you started your career, what did you envision for it and how is that the same or different from what it has grown into? I ain't going to lie, I knew I was going to make it. I always had faith in myself, but I didn't know I was going to be as big as I am. I didn't think I'd be doing all of this. What has the adjustment to fame been like? I think I'm finally adjusting to it. The first two years I still wasn't used to it, but I think I'm getting used to it. I'm still appreciating everything that comes my way, though. I'm not taking nothing for granted. I'm still excited for everything. What do you hope people take away from your campaign? That I'm grown and sexy now. I used to be a little tomboy, but I'm 25 now, I'm in my golden era. I just feel like I done stepped into myself, into my grown woman era.

Doechii Knows Her 2025 Grammys Looks Demanded “A Certain Taste Level”,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/final-fitting-doechii-grammys-2025,"February 3, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"“Class is in session!” Last night, Doechii became the third woman to take home the Grammy award for Best Rap Album for Alligator Bites Never Heal. A lifelong student of hip-hop, the Swamp Princess paid homage to Jay-Z’s fondness for suiting in her Thom Browne looks. “I love telling a fashion story and that’s what we plan on doing at the Grammys,” Doechii told Vogue three days ahead of her award-winning night. And that she did. The newly minted Grammy winner wore not one but four custom Thom Browne looks for her banner night. Doechii on the red carpet at the 2025 Grammys. Accepting the Grammy for Best Rap Album. But just because she embraced the masculine elements of suiting and hip-hop culture doesn’t mean she abandoned the feminine. While she was torn on the red carpet look, Doechii settled on a off-the-shoulder gray pinstripe dress with corseting detail down the back, which she wore over a white Oxford shirt with Browne’s signature red, white, and blue armband. “I think that this is sleek and simple and to the point,” she says. “It tells a story and it’s direct.” Performing. Performing. After the Grammys. Luckily, the other look came in handy when accepting her Grammy. Doechii chose a high-waisted pannier trouser with a raglan sleeve jacket, which she loved for “the drama of it all.” “You have to have a certain taste level and an eye to immediately understand it,” she says. And that’s not to say anything of the other looks she pulled out… Watch as Doechii takes us along for her final fitting with Thom Browne ahead of the 2025 Grammys, and below see the behind-the-scenes of her Grammy-winning night.

Chappell Roan Brought Her Rodeo Clown Fantasy to Life at the 2025 Grammys,https://www.vogue.com/article/chappell-roan-does-balletcore-like-only-she-could-at-the-2025-grammys,"February 3, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"If there’s one thing to know about Chappell Roan, it’s that she loves a reference. At the 2025 Grammys, the pop star and her stylist, Genesis Webb, abided by a loose rodeo clown theme, seen from her red carpet look to her theatrical performance of “Pink Pony Club.” “Chappell established rodeo clown as the thematic foundation for the performance, which provided a conceptual starting point. She shared a Pinterest board of reference images, primarily featuring Galliano and Guo Pei,” Webb tells Vogue. “Think theatrical silhouettes, rich color palettes, and couture. That set the tone for something dramatic, whimsical, and visually commanding.” On the red carpet, the pop superstar tried her hand at balletcore. But there was no pink satin in sight: For her inaugural Grammys, Chappell met the moment in a tulle-heavy couture rendition of the famous Edgar Degas painting Dancer with a Bouquet. Chappell Roan at the 2025 Grammys. Chappell dug into the archives for the occasion, pulling one of the finale looks from Jean Paul Gaultier’s spring 2003 couture collection, originally worn on the runway by Mariacarla Boscono. The showstopping number featured painterly streaks of canary yellow and robin’s egg blue tulle across the bodice, which was also adorned with three-dimensional berry and flower embellishments and black velvet straps. The skirt fanned out into an asymmetrical silhouette printed with Degas’s famous ballerinas. “For the red carpet, I knew from the outset that archival couture was essential,” Webb tells Vogue. “Regardless of the designer, I wanted something with history; something that carried weight beyond aesthetics. Gaultier had been on my mind for her for some time, so I reached out, and when this particular archival piece was presented, I had an immediate visceral reaction. It wasn’t just an option, it was the dress. While I had several looks prepared for the fitting, this was the only one that truly aligned with the vision.” Chappell Roan at the 2025 Grammys. Mariacarla Boscono, Jean Paul Gaultier spring 2003 couture. While Chappell placed the original runway headpiece in her signature red hair, she swapped the original black velvet ribbon choker for a diaphanous blue one that coordinated with the dress. She added a pair of matching opera gloves with the fingertips cut off to allow her gold-tipped manicure a moment to shine. Chappell also eschewed the yellow button heels for a pair of round-toed yellow and black boots with turquoise detailing from John Fluevog. Inside the ceremony, Chappell changed into her second couture look of the evening. Inspired by look 8 from his fall 2024 couture collection, Thom Browne fashioned the singer a blue wool and silk cropped jacket with exposed shoulder pads, a blue corded lace corset, and a tiered, hand-pleated asymmetrical petticoat.

Chappell Roan, who earned six Grammy nominations—including for album of the year and best new artist—also hit the stage in custom Zana Bayne and Steve Madden boots for a rodeo clown-inspired performance of “Pink Pony Club.” “For this Grammy performance look I  combined aspects of all the silhouettes we’ve done on her in the last year and make a ‘super Chappell’ look,” Bayne tells Vogue. “Throughout the costume are special details to bring the rodeo clown princess fantasy into reality, with everything crafted in my downtown Los Angeles studio.” Performing in custom Zana Bayne. Her only ready-to-wear look of the night, Chappell took home the Grammy for Best New Artist in a gray Acne Studios dress festooned with bows from spring 2025 collection. She kept up the princess theme from her performance in a yellow Piers Atkinson hennin, which promptly fell off during her acceptance speech. But who needs a hat when you have a Grammy?

Forget Oxblood! Jennifer Lawrence Declares Cobalt the New It-Color,https://www.vogue.com/article/jennifer-lawrence-new-it-color-cobalt,"February 3, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"For the last couple of years, Jennifer Lawrence’s wardrobe has been defined by her love of the “pop of red” styling trick. Be it jelly shoes, a slip skirt, or an accent sweater, the actor stayed loyal to reds of every variety. But lately, as everyone’s affections have turned to red’s cousin oxblood, Lawrence is doing a complete 180. Over the past few months, the expectant mother has turned her allegiance to blue. While she’s worn more muted shades, Lawrence has seemed especially fond of bolder hues. Today, however, she donned the loudest blue to date in a vibrant cobalt sweater while on a walk in New York City. She added to her attention-grabbing look with a leopard print coat from By Malene Birger. Lawrence kept the rest of her look lowkey in an off-white cloche, oatmeal scarf, billowing black trousers, and black ballet flats. It seems like Lawrence is looking into the crystal ball when it comes to color trends. The spring 2025 season was chock full of electric blues, from jackets at Chloé and Balenciaga, to dresses at Valentino and Schiaparelli. While fresh-off-the-runway pieces remain out of reach to most, Jennifer Lawrence is modeling a more accessible way to test out new trends.

“Black Dress II: Homage” Celebrates A History Of Black Fashion In America,https://www.vogue.com/article/black-dress-ii-homage-pratt-exhibition,"February 3, 2025",By Aemilia Madden,"At Pratt Manhattan Gallery on 14th street, a celebration of Black designers and creatives rises to honor the work of generations. “Black Dress II: Homage” explores the history of American fashion, through the lens of the Black artists whose work has pioneered and defined the industry, often without recognition. The show marks the ten year anniversary of the original “Black Dress” exhibit, created in 2014 by Adrienne Jones, a tenured professor at the Pratt Institute. Jones received a series of scrapbooks from Clara Branch, a former faculty member at the Fashion Institute of Technology, as well as Jones’s mentor. In them, she found a careful catalog of Black designers, some of whose names had since been lost to history. So was born “Black Dress,” an exhibit intended to share and preserve their legacies. “This is a love letter to the fashion industry, particularly the Blacks in fashion… but also to Clara Branch, continuing her legacy,” says Jones. Who knew that some scrap clippings would turn into what it is today?” Today, Jones and her co-curator Rachelle Etienne-Robinson are reviving the legacy with an expanded viewpoint, curating the work not only of fashion designers, but of Black creatives whose work covers beauty, styling, and celebrity culture. There will be a part of the exhibit celebrating fashion journalism titled Black Book; for jewelry it’s Black Gold; for models, Black Face. A number of brands from the first exhibition will return including Byron Lars, Sammy B, and Epperson. Their work will sit next to renowned designers of decades past, from CFDA Award winner Jeffrey Banks, to Haitian-born Fabrice—known for his opulence—to Patrick Kelly, a beloved designer of the 1980s. Two-time Oscar nominated costume designer Paul Tazewell (including currently for Wicked) lent costumes from The Temptations. There will also be a piece from the 2024 Olympics designed by Telfar Clemens. Curating the collection involved not just the years of hard work put in by Jones and Etienne-Robinson, sometimes it was also about a bit of luck. The two were hunting for a specific ironing board, to be displayed as an homage to Sarah Boone, a formerly enslaved woman who had the patent for what became the modern ironing board. All set to buy the piece, a well-timed conversation suddenly found them with one in their possession, lent by a friend. For Emmy-nominated producer Keli Goff, the current exhibition will be her first time lending a piece of clothing from her own closet. Goff, who describes her collecting as a hobby turned obsession, was put in touch with Jones and Etienne-Robinson as they were searching for a Patrick Kelly dress to include. “You've got to either give me a year or a color or a print or something, because I have a lot,” Goff remembers telling them. News often travels by word-of-mouth in the network of Black fashion collectors and curators. Goff, attending a luncheon with her beloved Patrick Kelly dress in hand to drop off at Pratt after, was approached by author and former Vogue writer Nell Scovell. It turns out, Scovell owned the matching dress to Goff’s pink and white jacket, a piece which she had purchased on the day she learned that Kelly had passed away. Now, the two will be shown in the exhibit together. A museum exhibition is an opportunity to witness both the evolution and sheer volume of Black talent, bringing together works that span decades. But, outside of the museum walls the work continues. Says Jones, “we want to pay homage to those who have been doing the work and haven't necessarily gotten the recognition that they deserve” One issue Jones found in curating the first “Black Dress” exhibition was lack of preservation. In researching previous exhibits on Black designers, she found that assembled knowledge often disappeared once the show’s tenure ended. Any history gained, was lost again. Between the first and second exhibits, Jones built a lasting infrastructure, including a website and talk series with the intent to protect and expand the knowledge collected in curating the show for future generations. A continuation of Branch’s legacy, defined by the digital age. Though it leaves curators divided, Goff explains that she wears many of her pieces, including on the red carpet, as a way to spark conversation about forgotten designers or those who have yet to get their due. “It's a larger conversation about accessibility and storytelling,” she says. Worn once, precious items like her Ann Lowe dress will now remain tucked away and protected until they’re safely situated at their final home in a museum. With hopes of a potential tour or permanent space, Jones and Etienne-Robinson see the current exhibition not as an end-point, but as the next step in their journey. “We're not saying that this is everybody,” says Etienne-Robinson. “It still continues to grow and evolve.” A good sign: Etienne-Robinson and Jones are already fielding emails from designers wondering why they weren’t included in the show. “We're two people doing this work and there’s still a lot of work to do.” “Black Dress II: Homage” is on view at Pratt Manhattan Gallery through March 22,2025. The exhibition is free. Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

Lady Gaga’s Abracadabra Is a Freaky Fashion Fantasy,https://www.vogue.com/article/lady-gaga-abracadabra-music-video-fashion,"February 3, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Abra—abra,ca-da-bra! If you’re a serious Lady Gaga fan, you likely have not been able to get that catchy chorus out of your head for the past 12 hours. Last night during the Grammys, the superstar debuted her latest single and music video for “Abracadabra,” her second single off her forthcoming album “Mayhem,” out in March. And boy, we are so back: The pop star made a grand return to her dark-pop roots, delivering a catchy dance anthem that hits hard on the dance floor. Better yet, she also released a spooky-chic video that is filled with avant-garde fashions. The artful video was styled by Peri Rosenzweig and Nick Royal of Hardstyle, and all of the eerie high-fashion looks were created by artists such as Seth Pratt, Suman Gurung, Iggy Soliven, Anastasia Vikhoreva, and Galedi. (Choreography, meanwhile, was done by Parris Goebel, who has also worked with global superstars such as Rihanna.) Hunter Clem and Genesis Webb, who dresses Chappell Roan, styled the background dancers. The fashion focus? “dance . . . or die.” Gaga’s new video sees the superstar battle it out on the dance floor as three different versions of herself, while Mother Monster watches and judges from above. Her first look is a red leather latex cape, adorned with real nails, made by the New York-based latex artist Renee Masomian. To punctuate the ensemble, Gaga sports a spiked and wide-brimmed hat made by Maximilian Gedra, a Berlin-based designer. On one hand of the ring, an angelic Gaga wears a custom white Olivier Theyskens catsuit, adorned with sheer panelling and hook-and-eye closures that were formed into the shape of a cross. As reported by La Maison Gaga, the look was inspired by the designer’s spring 1999 collection. Gaga also wears a high-collared white lace coat made of repurposed wedding dresses, designed by Ilona, Gurung, and the Australian-Taiwanese designer Samuel Lewis. (Lewis also made her leather Grammys red carpet look last night.) On the other end of the ring, a red-clad Gaga sports a dominatrix-style gown with a bubble-hem bustle by Lewis. Her red Stephen Jones balaclava and brimmed hat—and red Chrome Hearts boots—complete the theatrical ensemble. As for the finale dance number, Gaga ends on a more ethereal note with a fitted white corset bodice and shredded skirt, also from Lewis. All of the intricate jewelry, including those big cross pendants, were made by Dosisg6c, who has designed many pieces for the superstar. The marathon of custom looks, which evoke stirring haunted glamour, marked a fine return to what Gaga does best: chic weirdness. Now sit back, relax, and get ready to dance as you watch the stylish spectacle below. “Feel the beat, under your feet—the floor’s on fire!” More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

Kendrick Lamar Perfected Hater Fashion at the 2025 Grammys,https://www.vogue.com/article/kendrick-lamar-perfected-hater-fashion-at-the-2025-grammys,"February 3, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"As Drake once said, “Kendrick just opened his mouth, someone go hand him a Grammy right now.” And that’s exactly what the Recording Academy did. At the 2025 Grammys, Kendrick Lamar took home five awards for his song “Not Like Us,” including Song of the Year and Record of the Year. Lamar’s sweeping success was seemingly the final nail in the coffin in his bitter feud (one so notorious it has its own Wikipedia page) with the Candian rapper. But while the Academy made their allegiance clear (judging by the utter glee with which the music industry’s upper echelons hollered “A minoooooor,” he was the uncontested victor), he didn’t stop there. While Lamar’s unrivaled pen has earned him a Pulitzer Prize, he turned to his fashion to rub a little salt in his rival’s wound. Kendrick Lamar posing with his Grammys in a Maison Margiela Canadian tuxedo. He took to the stage in a jean jacket over a white tee, light-wash pants, and a matching baseball cap from Maison Margiela, yet another form of wordplay: the denim-on-denim look is otherwise known as a Canadian tuxedo, taking aim at Drake’s home country. The rapper accessorized his double denim with an enormous, diamond-encrusted Jesus piece around his neck and a pair of black leather lace-up shoes. Lamar’s sartorial statement did not go unnoticed. X users were quick to point out his subtle, yet thoughtful jab. “kendrick inspires me to be a bigger, deeper, more passionate hater,” one person posted. “While wearing a Canadian tuxedo is diabolical work,” another added. Even rapper JPEGMAFIA commented on the outfit: “LMFAO Kendrick is funny AF. He accepted his award for the greatest diss song of all time. in a CANADIAN TUXEDO.” Accepting a Grammy for “Not Like Us.” While he may have won the night, it’s highly likely Kendrick Lamar will let up any time soon.

Jennifer Lopez Went Full Winter Glam for the 2025 Grammys After Parties,https://www.vogue.com/article/jennifer-lopez-grammys-after-party-winter-coat,"February 3, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Fresh off attending the Sundance Film Festival earlier this month, Jennifer Lopez touched down at the 2025 Grammys last night, where she was one of many A-list stars in attendance. The singer and actor was on hand to present the Best Latin Pop Album award, which went to Shakira. (Who better to do the job, after all? The two performed the 2020 Super Bowl together). While J. Lo's look inside the ceremony was head-turning—thanks to that sculptural sheer Stéphane Rolland skirt, paired with a black turtleneck—it was her after-party look that evoked a whole other level of glamour. Lopez stepped out to grab dinner post-Grammys in a bold ensemble that was all about winter glam. She essentially found the most extravagant outerwear possible: a pink faux fur coat embellished with little rhinestone bows. It’s a far cry from a practical puffer or wool top coat, but this is Grammys weekend, a time for celebrities to take a risk and have fun with fashion. She paired it with a textured cream jumpsuit and her signature shoe, a sky-high platform sandal. Lopez in her Grammys look Lopez is always on board with a good statement coat. On numerous occasions, she has stepped out in plushy faux furs, styling them with classic tees and jeans, or her go-to Timberland boots. But this latest Barbie-pink style brings elevated winter dressing to new heights. We’re surprised she didn’t sport it during Sundance, where a cozy-chic wardrobe is always encouraged. But its Hollywood outing was just as fabulous.

See Every Look from the 2025 Grammys Red Carpet,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/grammys-2025-fashion-live-from-the-red-carpet,"February 3, 2025",By Vogue,"Last night the 2025 Grammys took place at Los Angeles’s Crypto.com Arena—the first awards show since devastating wildfires ravaged the city last month. The ceremony, hosted by Trevor Noah for the fifth consecutive year, set the tone for the rest of the season as people grapple with celebrating artistic achievement in the wake of tragedy. In January, the Recording Academy, MusiCares CEO Harvey Mason Jr., and chair of the academy’s board of trustees Tammy Hurt confirmed that the ceremony would go on last night as planned. “This year’s show, however, will carry a renewed sense of purpose: raising additional funds to support wildfire relief efforts and honoring the bravery and dedication of first responders who risk their lives to protect ours,” they wrote in a joint statement. Beyoncé led the 67th Grammy nominations with 11 nods, while Charli xcx, Billie Eilish, and Kendrick Lamar followed her with seven apiece. While the big four categories were nail biters, the race for Best New Artist was also tight, with breakout stars Doechii, Chappell Roan, and Sabrina Carpenter all up for the prize. See all the winners from the 2025 Grammys here. The Grammys know no shortage of exciting fashion moments: last year alone Doja Cat wore an attention-grabbing Dilara Findikoglu dress with a host of gothic temporary tattoos, while Lana del Rey wore a black velvet dress she thrifted herself, and Taylor Swift donned custom Schiaparelli to announce her newest album, The Tortured Poets Department.

Everything You Need to Know About the Fall 2025 New York Fashion Week Shows,https://www.vogue.com/article/new-york-fashion-week-fall-2025-preview,"February 3, 2025",By Vogue Runway,"New York Fashion Week is getting off to an early start tonight with a Marc Jacobs show. He’s presenting a see-now, buy-now spring 2025 collection at the New York Public Library and it’s sure to be pointed. In his show notes last time around, he wrote, “I believe in living with authenticity—free from validation and permission of absurd conservatism and societal norms,” and the world has only grown more absurd in the interim. How designers will reckon (or not) with America’s new reality is one question on our minds. Also: What will Veronica Leoni’s Calvin Klein look like? Which of the week’s new names will rise above the fray? And what will Kendrick wear to the Super Bowl? Read on for our educated guesses. Calvin Klein by Francisco Costa and Raf Simons. When Veronica Leoni makes her Calvin Klein debut on February 7, it’ll be the first time the American brand is on the New York Fashion Week schedule in six and a half years. Back in September 2018, Raf Simons gave us references to Jaws and The Graduate. Before him, Francisco Costa had moved the label in a conceptual, avant-garde direction. Given her background—she came up through the ranks at Jil Sander, Phoebe Philo’s Céline, and The Row—Leoni’s take is likely to be aligned more closely with that of Calvin Klein himself: efficient yet sensual minimalism built for real life. When she was hired, Leoni said, “For decades, Calvin Klein interpreted the idea of bold self-expression, and I am willing to empower it with a strong accent on style and creativity.” Whichever way she goes, it’s exciting to have this headliner back in the mix. —Nicole Phelps The season officially kicks off on Thursday, but on Friday, a bit of New York Fashion Week will be found in New Orleans, where Emily Adams Bode Aujla is staging a runway show for her latest Bode Rec. collection with the help of our good friends over at GQ. Bode Rec., which the designer launched last fall timed to a collaboration release with Nike, is where the designer digs into “the importance of sports in American society,” as she put it at the time. GQ is known for throwing a great party, and Bode Aujla has been absent from the New York (and Paris) calendar in recent seasons, so this is sure to be a fun time. Not in New Orleans? No problem; you can catch the livestream on GQ.com and check out the images on the Vogue Runway app. Expect to see some football stars and the people who love them in the crowd. Super Bowl LIX is two days later at New Orleans’s Caesars Superdome. —Laia Garcia-Furtado Kendrick Lamar in Louis Vuitton at the 2022 Super Bowl. The Super Bowl is once again taking place during Fashion Week (a Venn diagram that intersects more than you think; Vogue and GQ editors are rooting for the Philadelphia Eagles by a wide margin, by the way). Adding to the pressure for the day’s shows to start on time, Kendrick Lamar is this year’s halftime performer. We already told you about Lamar’s Super Bowl collaboration with Willy Chavarria. Now the focus is on what he might wear—he’s not fashion’s favorite rapper for nothing. Might it be a little sneak peek from Matthieu Blazy at Chanel ahead of his first show for the maison? Or will he once again partner with longtime collaborator Martine Rose for another internet-breaking fashion moment? One thing’s for sure, we’ll be tuning in to find out. —Irene Kim Serenity wears a handwoven-on-dress-form sheath using cotton and wool yarns from Gabe Gordon’s fall 2025 collection. Each Fashion Week brings a fresh batch of new names for the industry to scrutinize. Last season it was Patricio Campillo’s turn; the young Mexican designer made such a big impression that he’s back on the schedule this Friday. Two years after her first-ever show at St. Mark’s Church-in-the-Bowery, artist-cum-designer Zoe Gustavia Anna Whalen is making her on-calendar debut on Monday. Other up-and-comers to watch out for include Gabe Gordon, a knitwear wunderkind who staged his first off-calendar show last season, and Kari Vettese, who is bringing her Los Angeles–based label Vettese and its sumptuous shirred knitwear and roomy tailoring to New York. And don’t miss the gender-bending, cool-kid catnip of LeBlanc Studios. The brand, founded 11 years ago in the Dominican Republic by Angelo Beato and Yamil Arbaje, is staging its debut runway show Stateside. —José Criales-Unzueta Timothée Chalamet in New York City in January. Lily-Rose Depp in New York City in December. Here at Vogue, we scout for trends both on and off the runways. While we don’t yet know what the weather gods have in store for us during New York Fashion Week, we do have a couple of street-style predictions, both of which come from our well-dressed celeb friends. Expect to see many of our city’s stylish denizens in Tabi flats and trench coats (buttoned to the top like Nosferatu star Lily-Rose Depp is prone to do). Another surefire trend: thin scarves and Citi Bikes à la Timothée Chalamet. —I.K. Stella Hanan walks the Alaïa spring 2025 ready-to-wear show in New York. Some people were simply meant to be models, like Stella Hanan, the up-and-comer who just so happened to walk her first-ever runway at Alaïa’s New York show last season. The young model with big, doe-like ocean blue eyes was casually shopping at a weekend flea market in Australia when she was discovered by a casting agent. These days, you can find her traveling to all the major fashion cities and walking all the big shows. “After Alaïa, she walked Khaite, Michael Kors, Gucci, Versace, Chloé, Schiaparelli, and all the other It brands—she’s just that girl,” says Ignacio Murillo, Vogue’s global casting director. According to Iggy, it isn’t just her “impeccable beauty” that makes her stand out but also her wonderful and charming personality. —I.K. After a season off the NYFW calendar following the departure of Paul Helbers, Fforme is back in the official lineup once again, this time headed up by Frances Howie. The New Zealand–born designer studied at Central Saint Martins and worked at Lanvin under Alber Elbaz before moving on to Stella McCartney. In a matter of a few seasons, Fforme became a buzzy IYKYK label, and we can’t wait to see Howie’s take on the sculptural clothes that made New York City women fall for it. Ffrances for Fforme has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it? —L.G-F. The view inside the main dining room at Cafe Zaffri. In New York, there’s always a cool new restaurant or bar to check out, and this week the place to see and be seen will definitely be Cafe Zaffri, the new spot from the team behind Raf’s and Musket Room. The sprawling dining room in the former home of Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt Shepard—now the Manhattan location of the British members-only club the Twenty Two—feels cozy and tucked away despite the fact that it’s right off Union Square, one of the busiest (but also most accessible spots) in the city. The perfect place for a breakfast meeting or a gossip sesh over a cocktail and a bite of its delicious Middle Eastern food (we are partial to the octopus and harissa skewers and the baklava). —L.G-F. In case you missed it: Christie’s will be auctioning a collection of Iris Apfel’s extraordinary objects, jewelry, and accessories. Titled “Unapologetically Iris: The Collection of Iris Apfel,” the lots include everything from a sculpture of Apfel riding a scooter to a case of 18 multicolored eyeglass frames to a range of utterly fabulous looks by Carolina Herrera, Geoffrey Beene, Bill Blass, and more. The sale closes on February 13, with a public preview happening on February 5, right before the shows. Keep your eyes peeled for Apfel’s treasures in our street-style galleries. —J.C-U. Lori Bellilove opens Batsheva’s fall 2024 show. Batsheva is missing from the official NYFW calendar, but fear not: Designer Batsheva Hay is staging a presentation on the evening of February 16 starring dancers from the Isadora Duncan Foundation. Hay met Lori Bellilove, who heads up the foundation, three seasons ago when she was doing street casting for her now-iconic fall 2024 runway show. Bellilove opened, doing a signature Isadora Duncan dance and setting the tone for the evening to come. Since then, the two have become really close, and Hay has grown particularly interested in Duncan. “I think Isadora was very punk, and I’m all about her mindset. She took her dance practice outside the confines of the small dance world and studio,” said Hay. “As someone who feels a bit like a fashion outsider, that spoke to me. My aim is to make clothes that people want to move through their lives in and feel like their most beautiful selves, not just wear to feel like a part of the establishment.” It promises to be a great time. —L.G-F. Yours Truly by Peter Jensen spring 2025 ready-to-wear. Fifteen years after he first showed in New York, Peter Jensen is back. “[The city] feels like an old friend you haven’t seen for a long time,” said the designer, who teaches at SCAD and runs his own business. Somehow he’s found the time to launch a new brand, Yours Truly by Peter Jensen, which is centered on sustainability and made and produced in the UK and his native Denmark. The fall 2025 collection will build upon the one he showed in Copenhagen last spring, which featured capes knit from strips of vintage T-shirts, voluminous tulle confections, and, of course, plenty of Jensen’s signature wit and whimsy. —Laird Borrelli-Persson More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

Samara Joy’s 2025 Grammys Look Is the Start of Many Major Fashion Moments,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/samara-joy-amanda-murray-grace-ling-grammys-look-2025,"February 3, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"“To be here, by just being myself, by being who I was born as...I’m so thankful,” Samara Joy told the standing ovation-ing crowd at the 2023 Grammys. At just 25-years-old, Joy is now a five-time Grammy award winner, winning Best New Artist just months after graduating from college and releasing her debut album. Last night, the Bronx-born jazz singer won both her categories at the 2025 Grammys. Joy, so astute in her musical journey and her own authenticity, arrives with a newfound clarity. It’s a story she’s telling this time through her fashion. “I want to wear clothes and outfits that make me feel like me, but also make me feel fabulous and sophisticated,” Joy tells Vogue. “I want to be able to look in the mirror when I get ready for an event, or even just walk down the street, and feel like I’m stylistically saying: ‘This is exactly who I am, personified in fashion.’” This new sense of sartorial discovery started after Joy was introduced by a mutual friend to stylist Amanda Murray just two weeks ago. “Our collaboration has been me putting the utmost trust in Amanda and her vision,” says Joy. “With her career taking off so quickly, she hasn’t yet had the opportunity to explore fashion in an intentional way,” explains Murray, a personal stylist and creative consultant with an innovative personal wardrobe that champions mind-expanding silhouettes, color, and texture. “This is an entirely new chapter for her—one where she’s consciously shaping how she presents herself to the world.” Murray attended Grace Ling’s spring 2025 show, where sensual and surreal designs—and a particular look worn by Precious Lee—took residence in Murray’s mind. “It was effortlessly chic, and seeing a fuller-figured woman on the runway in a beautifully designed dress—one that felt intentional rather than an afterthought—was refreshing,” Murray says. “While body diversity has made some strides in fashion, the representation we see on the runway often doesn’t translate to what’s available in stores. Grace’s commitment to bridging that gap is commendable.” She reached out to Ling last week to inquire about dressing Joy. Ling loved the idea of the “unexpected yet exciting” collaboration. Joy and Murray texted back and forth about building her look. “I’m glad for the openness. That’s something I’m working on myself—being able to recognize and say confidently what I like and don’t like,” says Joy. When she saw the dark, draped dress fastened with Ling’s trademark aluminium pins, Joy fell in love instantly. “I think I’m a modest girl, but I understand that accentuating and highlighting curves is what makes a look. I like being able to dress a certain way without showing too much.” The fitting process with Ling and her team was engaging and clarifying, giving Joy a sense of excitement for this major new journey into fashion. Murray, too, wants to foster a full fashion moment for a fuller-figured young Black woman. The industry, she says, tends to cater to a very specific kind of celebrity who they want to dress. “While I don’t want to make it solely about race, the reality is that some designers still refuse to dress Black women in the industry. They’ll cast Black models in their shows, but that’s where their inclusivity ends.” “Samara, as a Black woman with a fuller figure, doesn’t fit into their outdated standards—but that shouldn’t mean she’s excluded,” she says. “I firmly believe in fashion’s transformative power and its ability to uplift and empower. I wanted Samara to experience the joy of wearing a beautifully crafted dress that not only fits her well but also makes her feel seen and celebrated.” Joy also wore jewelry by Messika, wearing matching linked earrings, a three-finger ring, and bracelet. On her feet, she wore black patent Stuart Weitzman pumps. Her glam was done by celebrity hairstylist Shelbeniece Swain and makeup artist Kenya Alexis (who works often with Keke Palmer). “What I love about the look is that it’s simple, but it sends a message,” Joy says. “I think that's what this year’s Grammys is about. I’ve been on the road the last couple of years so I haven’t taken the time to present myself as my best.” For Joy, tour life has meant dresses that fit easily in a suitcase and don’t require too much thought…Or ironing. But Ling’s power for the subtle and striking details and confident simplicity have enraptured Joy, and propelled her onto new fashion terrain. “I’ve never worn anything like this before, so I’m looking forward to surprising people. ‘Oh, she decided to really step out, give some effort, remind people she can do this too,’” she says. And Joy’s fashion evolution parallels her own personal arc: “When I was starting out performing and touring I had no idea how to dress myself for gigs. I was shy, inward. That came across in my fashion—I thrifted most things. I don’t even like going into fitting rooms when I buy stuff! I find things that are easy and fit and hope for the best.” Now, she can confidently express her evolving aesthetic: “Elegant but still youthful; fun while still being modest and mature.” Going forward—whether in her forthcoming international tour, a sold out Carnegie Hall show in April, or more red carpet moments–Joy hopes to keep authentically articulating her sense of self through her style. Expect continued collaboration with Murray, and custom looks with assured, forward-thinking designers that share their vision. “I’m going to continue to show up as myself. I won’t let my view of what others do with fashion change me,” says Joy. “I hope to have more fun, more fittings, try new things, and continue to learn about myself through fashion.” Below, Samara and Amanda invite Vogue into her Grammys glam room.

Beyoncé Brings Western Couture to the 2025 Grammys—and Wins Best Album,https://www.vogue.com/article/beyonce-cowboy-carter-western-fashion-grammys-2025,"February 2, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Beyoncé’s a winner, baby! The musician attended the 2025 Grammys this evening, where she picked up a trophy for best album and best country album. (Taylor Swift presented the latter category, handing out her trophy to Beyoncé on stage.) The star becomes the first Black woman to win such country Grammy awards in 50 years. “I want to encourage people to do what they are passionate about,” says Beyoncé during her acceptance speech. “I think genre is a cold word to keep us in our places as artists.” Of course, the superstar had to bring out a themed look by Schiaparelli for the occasion. Though she skipped the red carpet altogether, Beyoncé put a glamorous twist on country-western style for her appearance during the ceremony. Call it rodeo couture—a sartorial vibe she is sure to continue on her upcoming Cowboy Carter tour later this year, announced just this weekend. (We are sorry to say that the dates are yet to be announced.) The star wore a figure-hugging gown embroidered with a subtle bandana pattern. To give it a more formal and Hollywood-ready feel, the dress featured sparkling sequins and beads in champagne and cream, and accessorized with matching opera gloves to boot. Surely it was a design worthy of walking down the step and repeat—but when you’re the legend that is Beyoncé, you can save your statement look for inside the show. She certainly looked the part of a winner.

Gracie Abrams Is Auditioning to Be the Next Chanel Bride at the 2025 Grammys,https://www.vogue.com/article/gracie-abrams-2025-grammys-chanel,"February 2, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Gracie Abrams is helping to usher Chanel into its next era. In the interim between Virginie Viard’s departure and the beginning of Matthieu Blazy’s tenure as artistic director, the Chanel atelier has taken up the mantle of designing collections and dressed celebrities. Tonight at the 2025 Grammys, Abrams’s look served as a nod to the house’s past—and a glimpse of its future. Abrams, who is nominated for best pop duo/group performance award for her song “Us,” turned to the French maison for her red carpet look. The Chanel ambassador wore the palest yellow chiffon off-the-shoulder dress, cinched at the waist with a black velvet ribbon and embellished with a satin camellia on her chest. Attached to her dress was a diaphanous chiffon hood that flowed behind her like a bride’s veil. Abrams accessorized with Chanel high jewelry: diamond earrings set in white gold with pearl drops, and white gold and diamond rings from both the high jewelry and fine jewelry collections. The dress, with its chic simplicity, camellia appliqué, and black velvet detail, felt reminiscent of Karl Lagerfeld’s Chanel—and is certain to pique the interest of fashion fans curious to see where the house goes next.

Sabrina Carpenter Shakes Her Tailfeathers at the 2025 Grammys,https://www.vogue.com/article/sabrina-carpenter-shakes-her-tailfeathers-at-the-2025-grammys,"February 2, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"By the time Sabrina Carpenter walked the red carpet at the 2025 Grammys, she had already taken home her first award of the night for Best Pop Solo Performance for “Espresso.” So it was only appropriate that the singer brought the party (in the back) in her baby blue marabou dress. For her big night, Carpenter and her stylist Jared Ellner leveled up the pin-up energy she brought to the Short n’ Sweet tour in a custom JW Anderson dress by Jonathan Anderson. The dress was steeped with drama, from the extreme backless silhouette to the Chopard necklace—with a massive pear-cut diamond pendant—acting as the halter neck and hanging down her back. Carpenter, who has previously used the red carpet to pay homage to Marilyn Monroe, seemingly continued her streak tonight, nodding to Shirley MacLaine’s character Louisa May Foster in the 1964 film What a Way to Go! While she loves a vintage reference, Carpenter made her Grammys look her own with the liberal use of ostrich feathers. The bottom of her gown, which fanned out around her, was trimmed with matching powder blue feathers, as were her hips. If we were Carpenter, we’d be shaking our tailfeathers too. The carpet look served as a prelude to Carpenter’s performance inside the Crypto.com Arena. She ripped off a glittering Dolce & Gabbana tuxedo to reveal a costume in the same shade of blue. Midway through the set, she performed an onstage quick change, draping herself in a feather-lined robe reminiscent of her dress. The Old Hollywood delight—complete with a tap interlude (in Christian Louboutins no less)!—practically demands an MGM contract for Sabrina Carpenter. Following her performance, Carpenter abandoned baby blue for a Grammys gold strapless sweetheart dress—which certainly came in handy, seeing as the singer took home the award for Best Pop Vocal Album.

The Best Dressed Stars at the 2025 Grammys,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/best-dressed-stars-2025-grammys-red-carpet,"February 2, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Tonight, the 2025 Grammys red carpet was host to some of the music world’s top talents. Given the 67th annual ceremony was all about celebrating some of the best records and performances of the year, it was only natural that the room was chockfull of A-listers—including household names like Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Sabrina Carpenter, Charli XCX, and more (all of whom were nominated for the prestigious album of the year award). Naturally, before the ceremony kicked off, plenty of statement fashions came out to play on the step and repeat. After all, the Grammys carpet has always been a playground for stars to deliver a bold look. Some of the evening’s highlights? The couture, of course. Best new artist nominee Chappell Roan played up her theatrical sensibility in a ballerina-inspired look from the Jean Paul Gaultier spring 2003 collection. Bonus points for her whimsical feathered headpiece and makeup. For a more moody and romantic feel, Lady Gaga showed up in a black leather Samuel Lewis look, complete with an archival Tiffany & Co. necklace from the 1930s. Olivia Rodrigo kept things simple and streamlined in a slinky black vintage Versace gown. Stars like Doechii, in Thom Browne, and Billie Eilish, in Prada, opted for more structured tailoring. As for some of the best dressed gents of the night? J Balvin looked elegant in his Dior opera coat, while Troye Sivan did breezy suiting in a lavender Prada ensemble—complete with a brooch and neck scarf.

Taylor Swift’s Red Hot Grammys Jewelry Hints at Her Devotion (and Maybe Reputation),https://www.vogue.com/article/taylor-swift-2025-grammys-jewelry,"February 2, 2025",By Margaux Anbouba,"Tonight, Taylor Swift attended the 2025 Grammys in a one-shouldered ruched mini dress by Vivienne Westwood—in a very intentional shade of Chiefs red, of course. But the outfit also came with a surprising accessory: a piece of thigh jewelry by Lorraine Schwartz with a single charm letter reading: “T.” Speaking in terms of Eras—because this is Swift, of course—I haven’t quite been able to pinpoint the current Era she’s dressing for. What I do know is that I’ve always considered myself more of a 1989 kind of girl… until tonight. First things first: Yes, this could be a “T” for Taylor—obviously I’m a feminist, and I thought of that too—but we know that Swift likes to wear the initials of her partners. In “Call It What You Want,” from her Reputation album, Swift sang: “I want to wear his initial on a chain round my neck not because he owns me but ’cos he really knows me, which is more than they can say.” So I’m going to suspend belief for a moment and imagine that the “T” stands for Travis (Kelce, duh) and that Taylor’s message is twofold: Offering a nod to her passionate romance with Kelce while also hinting that Reputation, Taylor’s Version is indeed coming soon. The relationship is hot—I mean, have you seen the photos of them kissing after he wins games?—and she wants them to know she’s devoted. And I have to say, I am obsessed. As a girl who wears a Hart charm necklace with the letter “R” hanging between my breasts like I’m Anne Boleyn (my partner’s name is Ramiro), I love devotion jewelry. So I guess it’s time for me to step up my game—calling Lorraine Schwartz asap.

Lady Gaga Brings Gothic Glamour—and a One-of-a-Kind Necklace—to the 2025 Grammys,https://www.vogue.com/article/lady-gaga-grammys-tiffany-necklace,"February 2, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Tonight, Lady Gaga hit the 2025 Grammys stage with Bruno Mars, to sing a special tribute to the city of Los Angeles in the aftermath of the wildfires (in a gauzy Valentino dress, no less). Before the ceremony kicked off, however, the superstar hit the red carpet in a striking leather jacket and full ball skirt by Australia-Taiwanese designer Samuel Lewis—after all, Mother Monster is the queen of gothic glamour. But it was her head-turning jewelry that held an interesting backstory. Wearing jewels by Tiffany & Co., Gaga wore the label’s archival necklace designed by Meta Overbeck under the direction of Louis Comfort. The gold style dates back to the early 1930s and is finished with tourmaline, pearl, and onyx. Gaga punctuated the look with yellow gold and platinum earrings with yellow and white diamonds, as well as a Jean Schlumberger by Tiffany & Co. Sixteen Stone ring featuring diamonds and tsavorites. It's not the first time Gaga has worn a piece of Tiffany & Co. jewelry with provenance. Fans will remember back in 2019 when the singer donned the yellow Tiffany diamond to the Oscars, which is valued at over $30 million, and includes over 100 carats of white diamonds. But tonight's Grammy's was certainly an occasion for a show-stopping accent: Gaga recently announced that she will release her seventh studio album, Mayhem, in March, following the release of her lead single, “Disease.” And if the red carpet fashions look this good in the lead-up to its grand release, we cannot wait for what comes next.

Olivia Rodrigo Sticks to Her Favorite Fashion Formula at the 2025 Grammys,https://www.vogue.com/article/olivia-rodrigo-2025-grammys,"February 2, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"As Olivia Rodrigo knows: If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it! Tonight at the 2025 Grammys, the singer remained loyal to her favorite label, wearing an archival piece from Versace for the second year in a row. Rodrigo opted for a slinky black number to celebrate her song “Can’t Catch Me Now” from The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, which earned her a nomination for Best Song Written for Visual Media. The sexy number was outfitted with a plunging neckline and back, and a mock neck that connected to two thin black straps. Rodrigo added an elegant touch with Tiffany & Co. jewels—a bracelet, pear drop earrings, and a ring on each finger. This vampy LBD feels like the sister to Rodrigo’s 2024 Grammys dress. Last year, the singer chose an off-white dress from Versace’s spring 1995 collection, originally worn on the runway by Linda Evangelista. While last year’s dress was embellished with pink and white rhinestones—punctuated with a bold red lip—this year saw Rodrigo opting for a simpler (albeit, sexier) look.

Taylor Swift’s Color of Choice at the 2025 Grammys? Chiefs Red,https://www.vogue.com/article/taylor-swift-2025-grammys-chiefs-red-dress,"February 2, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Taylor Swift, one of the most-anticipated attendees at the 2025 Grammys, has officially hit the red carpet. The singer—who is up for many of the top awards tonight, including album of the year—graced the red carpet in a glitzy one-shouldered ruched mini dress by Vivienne Westwood Couture. And it just so happened to be designed in her signature hue of the moment: bright red. Swifties will know that the star has been wearing red a lot over the past year. (And no, not as a nod to her 2012 album of the same name.) Swift has worn the color consistently as a way to support her boyfriend Travis Kelce, being spotted at many of his Chiefs games throughout the 2024 and 2025 season wearing various Chiefs-themed merch in shades of white and red. (This has included everything from kitschy little hats, to cool vintage Chiefs jackets.) Tonight at the Grammys, it was clear Swift wanted to revive the shade and continue her off-duty wardrobe streak. And she did it with a head-to-toe treatment—even wearing the matching satin heels, and a red rosary worn around the thigh. Do we think the “T” necklace stood for Taylor, or Travis? That’s for Swifties to dissect.

Jaden Smith Wore… a Castle to the 2025 Grammys?,https://www.vogue.com/article/jaden-smith-castle-headpiece-grammys-2025,"February 2, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"The Grammys red carpet is always a place for celebrities to deliver bold fashion statements. Over the years, wild outfits have dominated the event’s step and repeat—including that J.Lo Versace dress, and Lady Gaga showing up in an egg. (Iconic.) Indeed, the Grammys are a fun fashion spectacle—if not slightly unhinged. This year’s ceremony is certainly no different: Tonight, Jaden Smith walked the red carpet wearing a slick black Louis Vuitton suit, shirt, and tie, and completed the look with . . . a giant castle balancing on his head? It certainly made for one of the boldest accessory choices of the night. (Though, can we even call it an accessory?) The spooky black castle—which is giving serious Nosferatu vibes—did function as a wearable chapeau, featuring a handy little face cutout for easy viewing. It was custom-made by the brand Abodi, which prides itself on creating designs inspired by Transylvanian history. The bigger question, however, was: Why? Was there a hidden meaning behind the wearable art piece? Was he simply referencing and recreating an iconic Willem Dafoe GQ image? Fashion spectators are divided on the look. “You are not a vibe bro,” wrote one commentator of the look. But this is the Grammys: Perhaps there is no reason for the palatial hat at all, other than the sheer joy of turning heads and making a headline. That is what the Grammys red carpet is all about. And you have to give props to a star who is willing to take a risk. Smith has been taking this approach for years, after all. Remember when he carried his own hair at the Met Gala? A castle hat is just regular Sunday business for him!

Kim Kardashian’s Dress Is More Skin and Mesh Than Actual Dress,https://www.vogue.com/article/kim-kardashian-backless-dress,"February 2, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"It’s gala season, and we’re kicking off the year with the Fifteen Percent Pledge, a nonprofit that calls upon major retailers and corporations to dedicate at least 15% of space on their shelves to Black-owned businesses. It tends to be a jubilant, glamorous, and fashion-forward event—last night’s fourth edition was no different, with Kelly Rowland, Keke Palmer, and Teyana Taylor among attendees dressed to the nines (or fifteens!). The event, which is held at the beginning of Black History Month, kept to its Black designer and black tie dress code once again. Within that, a key theme of the evening’s attire was going bold and showing some skin, whether in sheer looks, or with a total lack of fabric. Kim Kardashian was on theme of course. She wore a high neck black leather gown with perforated chainmail panelling that reached down to the thighs, and across the lumbar spine-skimming back. She toted a tiny matching chainmail bag and wore towering black stilettos. The monochromatic and textured look is of course by a Kim Kardashian, fave: It’s custom Balmain by Olivier Rousteing. The Skims founder wore her dark hair in a short, slicked down and flicked out bob, with a deep side part. Her sharp nails were burgundy. For a glam evening, Kim tends to favor the open back dress, whether a leather Chrome Hearts custom with a plunging back and front for the CFDAs or a Cher-esque Versace frock that’s more cut-outs than anything else. Kardashian’s Skims co-founder Emma Grede (who is also behind Khloe’s Good American and Kylie Jenner’s KHY) was one of the evening’s hosts, alongside Fifteen Percent Pledge founder Aurora James, Tracee Ellis Ross, and Brandon Blackwood. Kardashian’s seatmate for the dinner was Kelly Rowland, who wore an acid yellow hooded gown with a silver clasp and a plunging chest cut-out, while Teyana Taylor wore a full LaQuan Smith suit with a spotted sheer open blouse. Keke Palmer donned a Sergio Hudson pale blue silk shirt dress with a fitted skirt and Western belt. The trio made it a fabulous evening for celebrating Black designers and founders.

Hailey Bieber Makes the Mommy Bag Chic,https://www.vogue.com/article/hailey-bieber-handbag-stroller,"February 1, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Hailey and Justin Bieber have spent much of the start of 2025 in New York, following a holiday season in Aspen. The Biebers made a rare appearance with their infant son Jack, and Hailey had the perfect mom bag to make both a chic and sensible night out with the family. Yesterday (January 31) on a chilly evening on the Upper East Side, the Rhode founder stepped out in a monochromatic black outfit, wearing a cropped black faux fur coat, black tailored pants, and pointed black boots. She wore sunglasses, her brown hair long and likely her latest product, the Rhode Peptide Lip Shape. Aside from her oval-cut wedding ring, vintage Piaget watch, and stylish Doona stroller for her five-month-old, Hailey Bieber’s main accessory of choice was a capacious black shoulder bag. As the trend of handbag shapes hath swung once again into the big and bold territory, Bieber has been shouldering larger bags from Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent, and even a Mrs Bieber-embroidered LL Bean tote. This time, she opted for The Row’s New Bindle leather bag: Its triangle silhouette and single draped handle make it roomy and comfortable, able to hold as many lip tints or baby formula as one may require. It’s been eight years since Bieber showed British Vogue what’s in her bag—we’re due a round two. Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

Happy 31st Birthday Harry Styles! Revisit 31 of His Best Outfits,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/harry-styles-birthday-best-outfits,"February 1, 2025",By Daniel Rodgers,"“Erm,” said Harry Styles when he made his television debut in 2010. “I work in a bakery? And I, like, serve cakes in the shop bit...” Then 16, the erstwhile One Directioner was dressed in a long-line cardigan and a scoop-neck tee with a thin scarf—printed with what looked like ancient hieroglyphs—looped around his neck. There was also a fabric bracelet, a “manacle” as it were, rolled up the length of his forearm. All of that was considered a real expression of someone’s fashion capital in the 2010s, particularly if that person’s Avenue Montaigne was a Topman in Redditch. But less than a decade—and a string of record-breaking world tours, albums, brand launches, high-profile romances, and Beatlemania levels of adulation—later, pop culture would elect Styles as its menswear god. Harry Styles’ best outfits reflect his continued creation evolution. Much of this was because Styles—in the tradition of a great number of performers before him—wore pearl necklaces and pussy bow blouses and high-waisted trousers and a woefully-underreported saloon dress. Even if the musician’s personal wardrobe rarely went beyond the limits of a cropped tee and jeans, his on-stage persona—masterminded by the stylist Harry Lambert and Gucci’s former creative director Alessandro Michele—was one of flamboyance: taut bod sprinkled with artfully-distanced tattoos but swathed in lime-green feather boas and sequined flares and fuchsia jumpsuits. A swaggering sex symbol rooted not in sleaze but silliness. Now 31, Styles is a brand founder and an angel investor in the British label SS Daley, sitting front row at the Liverpudlian’s London Fashion Week show in September. And though he seems to be taking a moment of respite from the public eye, his influence can be mapped across 2025’s heartthrobs: among them Timothée Chalamet, Kit Connor, Barry Keoghan and Jacob Elordi, who seem to have built their own image upon Style’s glittering blueprint. See also: the sheer number of heterosexual, civilian men who now feel emboldened to wear pearl necklaces—and the occasional bit of nail polish if they also happen to be amateur poets—on a night out. The only thing that is unforgivable—in my opinion—is the mainstreaming of one (one) dangly earring. It just about worked for a Met Gala themed around the word “camp”…Less so on my friend’s boyfriend who has made the courageous decision to experiment with songwriting. To celebrate his 31st birthday, scroll down to see 31 of Harry Styles’s best outfits over the years. Forgive him…It was 2010 and onesies were a rare novelty. Another piece of 2010s arcana. Quite Saltburn? The skinny jeans, the Chelsea boot, the band tee: All the trademarks of a 2013 rockstar in Florida. Harry attended the Burberry Prorsum Spring/Summer 2014 show in 2013 dressed in…Burberry. In 2015, Harry Styles distinguished himself from his former bandmates via this floral Gucci suit.

"Will Taylor Swift Attend the Super Bowl? If She Does, Here’s What She Should Wear",https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/taylor-swift-2025-super-bowl-fantasy-fashion,"February 1, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"With Super Bowl LIX just over a week away, there’s one question on everyone’s mind: will Taylor Swift be there? (Okay, that’s what everyone at Vogue is wondering, at least.) The face-off between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles is sure to draw a celebrity-filled crowd and we’re eager to see if Swift will travel to the New Orleans game to cheer on her boyfriend, Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce. Swift has been a regular presence at the Chiefs’ home games this season, where she’s worn a roster of on-theme outfits, ranging from a Vivienne Westwood corset and skirt to a red Louis Vuitton half-zip. But at last year’s Super Bowl against the San Francisco 49ers, she ditched team colors for a black corseted Dion Lee tank top, black cutout Area jeans with rhinestone embellishments, and black heeled boots. While we don’t know with certainty if Swift will attend the Super Bowl, we have some outfit suggestions—all in Chiefs colors, of course. Perhaps she could embrace her documented love of plaid in Bottega Veneta, Undercover, or Alexander McQueen. Or she could go for a true red in Miu Miu or Tory Burch. We’d love to see her lean into the drama in an oversized Stella McCartney scarf, or endorse a new designer in a Colleen Allen dress (or her Victorian fleece jacket). Below, take a look at our picks for Taylor Swift’s Super Bowl outfit. Sure, some may be a bit far-fetched, but just consider it our fantasy fashion league.

An Ode to Marianne Faithfull’s Forever Cool Eyewear,https://www.vogue.com/article/marianne-faithfull-sunglasses-eyewear,"February 1, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"The singular Marianne Faithfull has passed away at the age of 78. The formidable musician and actor, a muse to many but so much more than that moniker allows, a style icon, and a megawatt star of the Swinging Sixties—with the coolest eyewear to match. A doyenne of flower-power fashion, Faithfull’s wardrobe was Brit designer-forward, spanning python two-piece suits and collared mini dresses from Ossie Clark, thigh-skimming skirts via Mary Quant, and diaphanous, big-bowed shirts by Jean Muir, later of Yaeger. She set the reigning aesthetic for the ’60s, and as the era grooved on, Faithfull incorporated more of a sleek rock ’n roll glam, ensconced in sumptuous furs and velvet suiting, or clad in leather trousers and knee-high boots. Faithfull was never one to dim her light, but her collection of playful and shapely shades helped her propel through the kaleidoscopic era in style. Eyewear was her go-to accessory. Often, she swapped pieces with boyfriend Mick Jagger and even Keith Richards—his tiny, circular blue sunglasses were swiped more than once. Later, she was a muse for Chloé, Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel, and Hedi Slimane’s Saint Laurent; A delightful shot of Faithfull and Kate Moss sees them front row at Chanel’s spring summer show in 2004, both smiling wickedly behind their opaque sunnies. Another iconic image captures Faithfull leaving court where her then-boyfriend Mick Jagger was sentenced to three months in prison on narcotics charges. She wears a woollen, elegantly lapelled coat, a ruffled shirt, and belted suit pants; she stays cool and composed in her striped butterfly-shaped sunglasses. In one photo, she nabs Roy Orbison’s own trademark, matte black pair to pose. On the set of the erotic and electrifying Girl on a Motorcycle, Faithfull sits beside co-star Alain Delon in a full leather fit and oversized sunglasses, her tousled hair grazing the bugged out eyes. It’s a look that’s ready for the drag races, or a Batgirl audition. Faithfull was silhouette-agnostic, donning heart-shaped lenses, cat eyes, and brow-tipping sunglasses in colorful shades. A photograph taken of Faithfull during recording sessions for the Rolling Stones’ Their Satanic Majesties Request sees a spaced out looking Faithfull in far-out, insect-like sunglasses, an arpeggiated fringe brushing the rims. Have the picture colorized and it could be a shot from a Demna Balenciaga campaign. She loved color and patterns too, from tortoiseshell to plaid and amber toned frames. Her eyewear was usually cushioned by her coiffed blonde hair; her beauty aesthetic built intentionally around ‘notes on bangs’: From side-swept to feathery wisps, thick curtains, and a pixie fringed trim. This face framing and eschewing made her alluring, and unknowable. And for Faithfull, sunglasses were both mystery-building accessories and armor, for someone who had to battle back against the misogynistic music industry that sought to erase her as an artist in her own right. Keeping her eyes shaded kept everyone else guessing. Who is the sartorial successor today? Everyone from Julia Fox to Jennie Kim experiment with their eyewear, mixing the ultra feminine and the masculine, playing with silhouettes and sensuality. You could take a trip to London’s Camden market and peruse the vintage and bespoke numbers from General Eyewear, or trawl the stalls of west London’s Portobello Road for a treasure trove of Faithfull-esque frames. Seek out era-appropriate brands: Alain Mikli, Mary Quant, Biba. I’m sure in the coming months we can expect to see the ’60s oversized shapes take hold, and maybe some of Faithfull’s more cartoon-like silhouettes too. Of course, eyewear is just one lens to focus on the inimitable life of an icon. As she told British Vogue in 2004: “Marianne Faithfull is not fashion. Marianne Faithfull is a constant. Marianne Faithfull is a design classic, like a Ford Mustang.” Authentic, fearless, ready for the revolution—behind her opaque frames, you couldn’t read her, couldn’t ever tell what she was focused on next. And that’s just how she liked it. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

WNBA Star Satou Sabally Talks Bringing Her Stellar Game—and Style—to The Phoenix Mercury,https://www.vogue.com/article/wnba-star-satou-sabally-phoenix-mercury,"January 31, 2025",By Nick Remsen,"It’s one of those flawless Florida days, when the temperature is in the Goldilocks zone and the sun is cashmere soft, its hue shifting through the afternoon from lily yellow to haze gold. The glass block façade of the William H. Turner School in North Miami reflects this light in a thousand eighties-era squiggles, while the building’s pink and teal accents frame the Magic City-ness of the scene. Central in this vignette stands Satou Sabally, the 26-year-old WNBA star raised in Germany who played from 2020 to 2024 with the Dallas Wings, in a Y-3 outfit consisting of a silky black outsize jacket and roomy snap-closure trousers. Adidas’s tri-stripe trademark flanks her left leg, the high-contrast bands cutting a slope against the gridded wall behind her. (Y-3 is Adidas’s longstanding collaborative line with the Japanese designer Yohji Yamamoto). Sabally is at ease, smiling between shots; the big fit, and the Floridian environs, are “definitely a vibe,” she says. She has good reason to be happy: We’ve met just before the announcement of her new team, now confirmed to be the Phoenix Mercury. And, a week prior, Sabally signed with Adidas as their newest athlete partner. “I could not be more honored to join the Phoenix Mercury,” says Sabally, speaking exclusively with Vogue about the news. “This is truly a legendary organization and I’m humbled to follow in the footsteps of the many iconic players that have put on the Mercury uniform. I'm so incredibly motivated by the way ownership and the entire organization invests in its players. We get to practice in the best facilities and it's clear that everyone who is a part of this team is totally committed to delivering a title to this city. I'm excited to play in front of Phoenix’s fans and do everything I can to contribute to this winning culture.” Then, she continues: “I’m joining a team where I feel like I can get better and still develop my game. I’m looking for happiness—and performance.” Sabally, who is 6’4”, has had a remarkable career thus far. Her basketball roots go back to her childhood in Berlin. (Her mother is German, her father is Gambian, and Sabally was actually born in New York, but left the U.S. at a young age). She was first scouted as an adolescent, and by her late teens was playing for the Oregon Ducks out in the Pacific Northwest. There, she was named an All-American and won the NCAA’s Cheryl Miller Award, which is bestowed to the best Division 1 small forward in the country. Sabally would become the WNBA’s second draft pick overall in 2020, going to the Dallas Wings. She struggled with injuries early on, but hit her stride in 2023. That year, she was a WNBA All-Star Game starter and won the league’s Most Improved Player Award. Her nickname is “Unicorn,” given the rareness of her versatility. She produced all of this while also being on the German national team, and in 2024, she says her proudest moment was competing for her home country at the Paris Olympics. “I needed surgery beforehand, and I didn’t even know if I’d be able to participate,” Sabally says of the Games. “Within five months, I just had this amazing rehab, and I was really able to lean on the people around me. Friends of mine moved to L.A. to help me do this intensive rehab for 10 weeks. It was the whole process that made it so special, getting to that moment of standing on the court in Paris.” Community and camaraderie is important to the athlete—especially being in the States, away from most of her family, who still live in Europe. “I’m very 50/50 introvert and extrovert,” says Sabally. “That’s my assessment. I like to just sit on my couch in silence or listening to music—Quavo, Tems, and my all time favorite is Adele—but I also get my energy from my friends. They just charge me up. I don’t usually talk about basketball with them, but even if I do, I don’t know—it frees my mind. Friends make me feel like a normal person. I don’t need to be the strong personality that’s always out on the court.” Candace Parker, the former WNBA megastar and now president of Adidas Women’s Basketball, recognizes and echoes Sabally’s sentiment. “For her, and for us, it’s about relationships,” Parker says. “Satou and I had a candid conversation early on, saying, like, yes, I’m here for you professionally, but also for you personally. And she responded to that. She said, ‘I want to lean on you for that.’ That stuck out to me.” The Adidas link-up–athletics notwithstanding, nor the added synergy that both Sabally and the company are German–aligns with Sabally’s stylistic interests, which are prominent. In fact, over at GQ, readers once voted her as the most stylish player in the WNBA. At this point in our day, Sabally has changed from her Y-3 ensemble into earthen-gray performance gear; she’s about to film scenes for an Adidas global basketball shoot. Even with sportswear on, she carries the look with a cool candor, imbuing it with runway confidence. “I do care about fashion,” she says. “I love a good moment. Sometimes, I like to be playing around a little bit and look a little girly. Other times I’m representing a little bit more masc. I play with it!” She calls her wardrobe her “armor,” and cites Glenn Martens’ work at Diesel as a current favorite, as well as Willy Chavarria and Fear of God. Of course, as well: “Its every athlete’s dream to have their own Adidas shoe.” (This feels very much within the realm of possibility at some point, as I sneak a glance at a brand rep who is trying to hide a grin.) We move inside, to the school’s retro gymnasium. The same pastel paint and glass blocks are featured here, distorting the tall palm trees outside. Players including Aliyah Boston and Nneka Ogwumike—also featured in the Adidas shoot—are mingling, while crewmen move around screens and scaffolding. Professional women’s basketball has seen a major surge in popularity over the past year—think Caitlin Clark’s ascent, Angel Reese’s turning pro, and Jonquel Jones’s MVP-earning performance in at the 2024 Championships—and the energy in the room is, if placated by the Florida warmth, palpable regarding what’s to come. “I want the WNBA to be the number one thing people tune into,” says Sabally when asked where she sees the league five years down the line. “I want for players to have generational wealth through their performances. We’re continuing to lay such a strong and important foundation for future women in this sport. I want you to see every single WNBA game on TV, and I want the access to be broader. I want it everywhere, and for that to be normalized—because that’s how high our level of play is. We’re the standard.” Underscoring that, Sabally is vocal about combined players’ rights and advancements. She’s a Co-Chair of the WNBA’s Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). “I’m right there at the table fighting for us,” she says. “It’s really important for us players to unionize and know our power, and to also know that this can be a player’s league. Teams and organizations need to cater more to the players and really listen to their needs. And the investment has to be there; the standards have to shift.” Sabally cites certain teams not having proper training facilities, or some being penalized for certain expenses—like chartering flights—when others can’t or won’t. She wants higher thresholds to be set league-wide. Sabally, in all of this, is primed and eager to embark on her new course with the Mercury (especially after keeping her skills sharp in Miami, where she played in Unrivaled, a new 3-on-3 basketball league founded by the players Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart). The 2025 WNBA season starts on May 16; until then, Sabally will work on finding a new house and relocating to Phoenix, her CBA responsibilities, and pre-season training. How does she calibrate everything? “Having grace,” she says with a soft smile. “You have to have grace with your progress.” Sabally was styled by Natasha Hester in these film photographs.

The Runway Looks We Want to See During the 2025 Awards Season,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/2025-awards-season-dream-dress-runway,"January 31, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"It’s only been a day since Oscar nominations were announced, but we’re already dreaming up the looks we want to see on Hollywood’s biggest night. The 2024-2025 awards season kicked off with the Governors and the Gothams at the end of last year, and the Golden Globes ushered us into 2025. But devastating wildfires in Los Angeles quickly derailed the remainder of the schedule, with voting, nominations, and awards shows taking a pause. The Grammys announced that they would go on as planned on February 2, but with the additional plan to raise funds for wildfire relief. The sheer devastation in Los Angeles will undoubtedly color the rest of the season, and likely influence the fashion too. It’s possible that the looks will lean more conservative and eschew sparkle and embellishment for sleek, timeless fashion. (That said, we are still expecting Alessandro Michele’s Valentino to make a splash on the carpet.) The actors making the rounds this season—Mikey Madison, Demi Moore, Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo, Zoe Saldaña—all know how to own the red carpet. That said, we’re so dedicated to awards show fashion that we decided to pull some options ourselves. Consider some of the smaller designers like Christopher John Rogers, whose voluminous dresses make for a true showstopper, or the avant-garde Hodakova, who just took home the LVMH Prize. But we’re realists here, and we know that nominees tend to align with major fashion houses for marquee events. We love the sumptuous butter yellow Prada dress from the lauded spring 2025 collection, as well as the pink frayed georgette dress with silver embellishments from Seán McGirr’s Alexander McQueen. The couture spring 2025 shows also proved fertile ground for awards season fashion. Red carpet favorites like Armani Privé and Schiaparelli both produced breathtaking gowns that we’re sure to see on the carpet soon. Meanwhile, newer faces in the couture world also impressed: Ludovic de Saint Sernin (a growing red carpet presence himself) stepped into Jean Paul Gaultier’s guest designer role this season, while Michele tried out couture for the first time under Valentino. Beyond couture, Peter Copping’s debut at Lanvin also offered some real contenders. We’ve got some recent runway picks that will carry us through the start of the 2025 awards season.

Victoria Beckham’s Transparent Heels Come With a Medical Warning,https://www.vogue.com/article/victoria-beckham-transparent-medical-warning,"January 31, 2025",By Daniel Rodgers,"Brave is the woman in a transparent heel bearing the human foot in all its anatomical nakedness. These are difficult shoes to make work (a sort of non-item anchoring an outfit to nothing), which, as anyone who lived through 2016 knows, will also function as a terrarium, in which varying bacteria flourish no matter the podiatric preening involved beforehand. There are few people willing to let their dogs out in public, and even fewer of us who want to see them collecting condensation in the process. And yet Victoria Beckham looked good in the ones she wore to the launch of David’s Boss campaign last night: a pair of her own spring 2025 iterations, crafted from PVC and attached to a lucite Cinderella heel, which she styled with a knitted skirt set just gauzy enough to hint at full-body impropriety. The designer’s been wearing several versions of this less-is-more stiletto for a while, sidestepping her reliable Balenciaga pantaboots for Alaïa’s Cœur pumps at Paris Fashion Week and Saint Laurent’s Chica slingbacks to lecture the students of Condé Nast College. But a warning to those who are thinking of following suit: “The foot by itself [without a sock] in a shoe, plastic or not, provides a perfect milieu for fungal growth,” Dr. Rock Positano, director of the non-surgical foot and ankle service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, told Vogue’s Liana Satenstein back in 2018. “It is moist, dark and there is heat. The combination of those three things make a foot inside a shoe a dangerous place.” Isn’t danger just another way of saying… “temptation?” Jennifer Lawrence Adds Dad Shoes to Her Maternity Wardrobe Why Does Everyone Have a Belted Bag Now?

Timothée Chalamet Talks Designing His Own Merch—For 100 Lucky Fans,https://www.vogue.com/article/timothee-chalamet-a-complete-unknown-hoodie,"January 31, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Thanks to his commanding turn as Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown, Timothée Chalamet is now a 2025 best actor Oscar nominee—and his press tour style for the film over the past few weeks has been equally award-worthy. The star has rocked Chanel, rode a lime e-bike in a slick suit, and sported a thematic A Complete Unknown hoodie, which he wore during a recent visit to the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. (Dylan himself attended one semester at the school.) In the case of the hoodie, Chalamet designed it himself, as part of an exclusive collaboration with the Los Angeles-based brand Nahmias, releasing today. The black and white hoodie, which retails for $195, was designed specifically for Chalamet’s press tour, and is limited-edition: There are only 100 pieces available worldwide (that will likely sell out quickly). Chalamet worked with designer Doni Nahmias on the cozy piece, collaborating to find an aesthetic and silhouette that would reflect the star’s effortless personal style. “The collaboration with Doni came about naturally,” Chalamet tells Vogue. “It began with an appreciation for the comfort of his hoodies, and evolved into a friendship over the past year. Thanks to Doni’s passion and the discipline of his studio, we were able to bring the black hoodie to life quickly.” Rather than leaning into on-the-nose method dressing with a deliberately 1960s Bob Dylan look, the duo landed on a hoodie design that is more clean, minimal, and contemporary—and clearly speaks for itself, thanks to the bold logo work. “Timothée is a fashion-forward guy who constantly pushes boundaries and defines his own lane,” says Nahmias of the end result. “The collaboration process was fun and seamless. Timothée has great taste and came to the table with clear ideas and strong opinions about what he wanted. We worked back and forth to refine the pieces, making sure every detail was just right, and we were both stoked with the final outcome.” For Chalamet, the opportunity to design a film-themed hoodie all came down to the fans, as he wanted to give them an opportunity to own a commemorative piece of the film. “Seeing his passion for this film, and the incredible way he brought Bob Dylan to life, made it even more special,” says Nahmias of the hoodie. “It was a cool and special opportunity to play a small part in his journey.” So, Chalamaniacs: Now is a time to own a comfy piece designed by the man himself.

Dua Lipa Adds This New Role To Her Resumé,https://www.vogue.com/article/dua-lipa-is-the-face-of-the-new-chanel-25-bag,"January 31, 2025",By Tina Isaac-Goizé," On the heels of Dua Lipa’s appearance in the front row at the Chanel spring 2025 couture show in Paris, Vogue exclusively unveils her debut as the face of the house’s new hobo handbag: the Chanel 25. The campaign features the star dancing, running, and singing through the streets of New York, set against a soundtrack of the Fine Young Cannibals’ 1988 hit “She Drives Me Crazy.” A direct descendant of the revolutionary 2.55—which, at 70, remains one of the most sought-after handbags in the world—the Chanel 25 mirrors its time. The bag is crafted in supple, lightweight quilted leather, and the medium and large sizes come with a handy clutch that also can be worn solo, depending on the occasion. Lipa’s ties to Chanel date back to 2018 when, as a rising star, she turned to the grande dame of Parisian couture houses for an outfit to wear during a performance at the Grammy Museum in LA. As Vogue noted at the time, on anyone else that little white sweater set could have “veered into country-club territory,” but Lipa, who’s known for her eclectic sense of style, gave it a charismatic twist with a body chain and a Chanel choker. Five years later, in 2023, she donned three Chanel looks for her role as the co-chair of the Met Gala tribute to Karl Lagerfeld. Most recently, in November, her Radical Optimism tour got underway in Asia with custom looks by Chanel, notably black and white sequined and pleated tulle jumpsuits with tweed braids, and a smocked tulle dress with white sequins and black leather. Following this week's Chanel show, Lipa sat down in the VIP lounge to chat about her love of color, her first-ever Chanel purchase, and which Chanel 25 bag is her “drug of choice,” among other things. This conversation has been condensed for clarity. Vogue: The Chanel spring 2025 couture collection brough a rainbow of colors and ideas. What was your takeaway? Dua Lipa: I loved it, and I felt like the models really loved what they were wearing. There were pops of color throughout, I thought it was really fun. I particularly love the buttery yellow shirtdress. I’m always drawn to things that are yellow—not necessarily things I would wear, but in this case, I was like, ‘oh the romance!’ That dress is something I could see myself in, it’s so cool it’s like almost rock-and-roll. There’s a whole day-to-night vibe. And the red dress with the black belt, too. I could maybe add boots to toughen those up a bit, make them my own. The tweed looks were really beautiful as well, but those felt different. You’re often described as having an eclectic style. How would you describe it? It's just... fun. I do have a very eclectic style: My everyday stuff is just me going great and mad. It’s whatever feels good, which really depends on the day. Most of the time, I love a good pair of denim. What’s underneath is easy. Then I consider a bag or a jacket as the main part of my wardrobe. How do your roots affect the way you dress? Well, I traveled around a lot as a child, living in London, then I moved to Kosovo, and then I moved back to London. So, I think in that sense I'm very used to being on the move and adapting. I can do all kinds of different colors, all kinds of different styles. I think that informs the way I work, the way I dress, the kind of music I make. I don’t really have one defining thing, and I always love collaborating with those who maybe people don't expect me to. That's what’s fun about it. There's nothing too big or too daring. I'm ready to try it all. I’m not a uniform person at all. What’s it like to become a part of the Chanel family? It's amazing. You know, when I first signed my record deal in 2014, I left my job in a restaurant, and when I got my first big check, I went to the Chanel store. The first thing I bought was a Boy bag, it was all the rage. I was so proud. Later, I went and got a leather backpack. I think just the idea of being able to do that for myself was such an empowering thing. Like, wow, I bought that Chanel bag with my own money. I felt really proud of myself. For me, it carried a lot of independence. So, this campaign feels quite full circle for me. So which Chanel 25 did you choose to add to your collection? I’m definitely a “big bag” kind of girl: I put my whole life into it. I love to run around with big bags even at night because I prep for anything. My friends can ask for something and I’m like, don’t worry, I’ve got it, it’s in my bag. I'm in love with the 25 because I think it’s cool and timeless, and I can put my whole life in there. Which size and color? I love the black vibe because it goes with everything, but right now my drug of choice would be the silver one. I got one the other day and it already has all my stuff in it. It’s really bold, and now it’s my everyday bag. Tell us about shooting this campaign. We had a lot of fun doing that video. I just I loved running around New York. I loved working with [director] Gordon von Steiner. There was just this freeness about it; they basically said, just have fun. So we danced around and the energy on set was beautiful. It’s like when I get on stage, I just feed off the crowd. And here, with the team, it was just fun and free. Now, when I watch the video, I think that really shines through. Let’s talk about the Fine Young Cannibals: that song was a hit years before you were born. Did you know it before you sang it in this campaign? Yes, I did sort of know it, but now I know all the lyrics. I love it: I think it added to the energy–there’s this youthfulness and energy about it—she drives me crazy—you just want to let loose. Which brings us to your album, Radical Optimism. How do you apply that to everyday life? I think it's just rolling with the punches. No matter what, there's going to be ups and downs. I think as long as you keep a positive mindset and enjoy even the not-so-good bits, you learn from them. You do the most growing out of your comfort zone. So, there’s this radically optimistic side of me that's just like, ‘oh, it's gonna be okay.’ And whatever it is, it's a lesson learned. So, I think applying that to everything has been a game-changer for me. With all your success, do you still have time to go shopping just for fun? It depends. There are certain cities where I love to go shopping, like Tokyo, Paris or New York. In some places I naturally gravitate to the stores, and then sometimes I’m like, okay, where can I go? A restaurant, a museum, a good night out? So, different cities for different things, and I feel so lucky that I get to do that. So, you travel light? Everything’s in that one bag.

Photographed yesterday (January 30), Bieber headed to Bar Pitti, an old school Greenwich Village spot known for its chalked blackboard menu, classic Tuscan dishes, and glamorous crowd—the Biebers, Sydney Sweeney, Tate McRae included. She wore a cognac-colored suede jacket, black suit trousers, black loafers, and white socks, accessorizing with gold hoop earrings and black oval sunglasses. A suede jacket is a mainstay in the Rhode founder’s autumn winter wardrobe, whether as a long vintage coat or a blazer in various shades of espresso and caramel leather. Outerwear, too, is Hailey Bieber’s bag: floor-length vintage faux fur for Aspen, breezy tailored suiting for LA. The day previous, Bieber brought out another weather appropriate accessory in the form of a gray cashmere scarf that doubled as a Babushka bonnet when the New York City weather took a turn.

“I'm Back in the Game!” David Beckham on His Boss One Bodywear Campaign,https://www.vogue.com/article/david-beckham-on-his-boss-one-bodywear-campaign,"January 30, 2025",By Luke Leitch,"David Beckham is one of the most enduringly popular and gifted English soccer players of all time—so much so that the British press habitually calls him Golden Balls. He is also one of the most enduringly popular and gifted underwear models of all time. Tonight, more than a decade after declaring it was time to keep his pants on in public for good by retiring from the underwear circuit, Beckham unveiled his new Mert and Marcus lensed campaign for Boss One. Or as he put it: “Yep: I’m back in the game!” We were in London’s Lightroom space, home to Vogue’s recent Inventing The Runway exhibition. The corridors on the way down into the cavernous, screen-walled venue were lined by some of the images of Beckham which, by the time this post is published, should be generating exactly the level of focus on its new bodywear range that Boss was hoping for. Or as the company’s CEO, Daniel Grieder, put it: “Bodywear is an iconic product group: and with this campaign, we aim to inspire customers and fans of the brand worldwide more than ever."" David Beckham for Boss Bodywear. Photo: Courtesy of Boss. Beckham, for his part, name checked Grieder as the reason he’d decided to come out of his self-imposed underwear-exile to strip down and moisturize up for one last mission. “I'd said to my team so many times, ‘it doesn’t matter what it is, I'm not going back: I’m not doing another bodywear campaign.’ But when I sat down with Daniel and spoke with him about his vision and understood his passion, I was convinced.” Tonight Beckham was joined by his wife Victoria (on extremely cheery form), their son Cruz and his partner Jackie Apostel, plus friends including Gordon Ramsay, Guy Ritchie (who himself once directed a Beckham underwear campaign movie), Gemma Chan, Mark Ronson and Jodie Turner Smith. The room filled and anticipation built as the guests drank Golden Martinis mixed in honor of Beckham and waited for the Trey Laird creative directed campaign movie to premiere. When it did, we whooped as a set-up that blended Rear Window, the Naked Guy (but here not Ugly) from Friends, and that classic man-ogling 1990s Diet Coke Break ad unfolded. It involved Beckham returning home to a curtainless high-rise Manhattan apartment doing what Beckham does—vigorous sets of pull-ups, long showers, moody middle-distance staring, sprawled-on-the sofa snoozing—while attired only in a pair of Boss One boxer-brief trunks (although not always). Meanwhile from across the block, a growing crowd of girls and guys objectified with glee. David Beckham for Boss Bodywear. Photo: Courtesy of Boss. “We really wanted to take it back to an old school underwear campaign,” he said before the film aired. Back in 2008—before the category ‘bodywear’ was even a thing—Beckham sparked his first bout of underwear mania courtesy of a campaign for Emporio Armani which, like this Boss campaign, was shot by Mert & Marcus. Beckham said: “Working with them has always been special, and I trust them. So when we started talking about this campaign and me getting back into underwear, I told Daniel that I wanted to work with them again. When I walked out on set they were like: ‘Here we go again!’” Back in 2008 he confessed to feeling a little embarrassed about all the attention his first underwear campaign attracted, but tonight he said: “People are used to me doing this now! This is something I’ve been doing throughout my career, and I’ve never been afraid to push the boundaries. What we’ve done now I think, though, is to do that in a very elegant way.” Beckham turns 50 this year, which makes this campaign an especially inspiring example for his fellow Gen X-vintage gentlemen, especially those for whom being objectified from across the block is nothing but a distant memory (OK, fantasy). So how did he get in such especially Boss-level, hot daddy form? “I came into this in the same way I approach everything else: I prepared well,” he said. “Because it doesn’t matter what age you are, if you feel good in your skin then you should be able to do anything.” “Plus I trained!” he added: “To be honest, I’m always training, but for this I followed a 12-week regime: it was two workouts a day. I always train hard, but I was especially dedicated because I knew I was going into this.” David Beckham for Boss Bodywear. Photo: Courtesy of Boss. That training went hand-in-hand with a high-protein eating plan and a period of abstinence from alcohol. It was the food, Beckham said, that was especially challenging: “Because I love my food! And for this project to get in the best possible shape I cut out almost everything I love, including pizza, pasta, fried chicken, french fries… So at one point I said to my team: ‘The moment I walk off that set I’d love to be able to have a pizza, some fried chicken, and chips.’ And they did it! I walked off set, and they were standing there waiting for me. And actually it was the best pizza, fried chicken and chips I’ve ever eaten, still boxer-briefed up and tanned!” There have been other greats in this game, several of them also soccer players. Cristiano Ronaldo, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Freddie Ljungberg were all contenders. However when it comes to underwear modeling, the undisputed GOAT from the soccer world (and arguably the entire world, too) remains David Beckham, the Boss.

15 Archive Photos of Original Rock Chick Marianne Faithfull,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/15-archive-photos-of-original-rock-chick-marianne-faithfull,"January 30, 2025",By Susan Devaney,"Marianne Faithfull’s Swinging London wardrobe was as treasured as her music. The 1960s icon—who died on Thursday at age 78, according to a spokespesron—carved out a stellar career with hits like “As Tears Go By” and “The Ballad of Lucy Jordan,” not to mention her memorable performance in Jack Cardiff’s The Girl on a Motorcycle (1968). But it’s her innate sense of style she was perhaps most famous for. From silk neck scarves to knee-high leather boots and oversized collars, the singer set the sartorial tone for the decade while sidelining flower-power fashion. Whether in a leather jumpsuit or a colorful velvet suit, Faithfull set the stage alight, her blunt fringe becoming as legendary as her four-year romance with Rolling Stone Mick Jagger. In celebration of her life, below we take a closer look at one of Britain’s longest-reigning style muses. In a cuffed minidress, she poses for a portrait with her pet Dalmatian. In her go-to paisley patterned shirt, she hangs off a ladder in London for a promo shot. For her TV appearance on Thank Your Lucky Stars, she opted for a monochrome dress and classic black pumps. She liked to add a French-girl touch to outfits in the form of a silk neck scarf. Standing outside London’s National Film Theatre (now BFI Southbank), she looked every inch the star with a jacket shrugged over her shoulders and patent Mary Janes on her feet.

"Gabbriette Is Living Her Dark, Sexy Fairytale at Saint Laurent",https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/gabbriette-saint-laurent-mens-fall-2025-diary,"January 30, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"It feels like Saint Laurent’s sexy hosiery from fall 2024 was made for Gabbriette. For the brat muse (“Call me Gabbriette, you’re so inspired”), wearing the all-black look to the Saint Laurent fall 2025 menswear show in Paris was a no-brainer. “I think my personal style is quite chill, sleek, and mainly consists of all-black clothing. Lots of leather and texture, so I feel it fits Saint Laurent perfectly,” she says. “I have loved the tights and all the sheer bits from the recent collections and haven’t gotten a chance to wear them yet…so obviously went with this gorgeous black look.” While she spent the day of the show primping with a drink in hand, Gabbriette likes to bring an element of fantasy to her free time in Paris. “I love shopping here and when it’s a gorgeous day just having a little coffee and a stroll and pretending I’m in a movie,” she says. You could certainly say she brought that same energy to the Saint Laurent show. Follow below as Gabbriette takes Vogue along on her night in Paris.

Kate Middleton’s High Street Dress Is the Hardest-Working Item in the Royal Wardrobe,https://www.vogue.com/article/kate-middleton-zara-dress,"January 30, 2025",By Daniel Rodgers,"In October 2021, this magazine identified a super affordable Zara dress as the cornerstone of Kate Middleton’s professional wardrobe—having been worn first for a 2020 tour of local community projects in Bradford, before the then-Duchess of Cambridge recycled it on a visit to University College London, to discuss one of the subjects closest to her heart: Early years education. It popped up again on a royal visit to the Aberfan Memorial Garden in Wales in 2023, and just this morning for an outing to the Vale of Glamorgan—both fine reasons to pull out the old reliable. The Princess of Wales in 2021. The Princess of Wales in 2023. With the exception of a suede Giuseppe Zanotti pump, this dress is perhaps the hardest working item in the royal’s wardrobe. Its sensible houndstooth check and decorative neckline is symbolic of the Princess of Wales’s perceived role as one of the more approachable heads of state: a patron of several deserving charities, a group that now includes the Tŷ Hafan Children’s Hospice—a position previously held by Princess Diana while the service was in its fundraising stages—which she visited this morning during her first official “away day” since announcing she was in remission from cancer. The Princess of Wales at the Tŷ Hafan Children’s Hospice. Such trips have traditionally involved members of the monarchy sweeping into towns and villages throughout the UK—greeting crowds, taking photos with babies, cutting ribbons—but William and Kate have set about establishing a new model focused on generating funds for local communities. The royal couple were said to have raised £345,000 for regional non-profits based in Scarborough when piloting the scheme in November, and intends to galvanise a similar level of support for their chosen foundations—focused on children’s wellbeing and textile manufacturing—from today’s outing in South Wales.

How Sonam Kapoor Gets Ready For a Dior Couture Show,https://www.vogue.com/article/last-looks-sonam-kapoor,"January 30, 2025",By Christian Allaire," Paris Couture Week has been filled with A-listers, and the Dior spring 2025 show was particularly star-studded. In attendance were Jenna Ortega and Anya Taylor-Joy, as well as Sonam Kapoor, who allowed Vogue to document her getting-ready process in a new video. “Today’s show is very special to me,” the actor said as she began the glam process. “The artwork, which serves as the backdrop to the show, was done by Rithika Merchant; I was so inspired by her that I commissioned a special artwork when my son was born.” Kapoor and Dior share a long history. As a muse to the house for years, Kapoor remembers the first day she began working with the French house. “Dior and I have had an associations since I was 22 years old, for my film Aisha,” says Kapoor. “Dior lent me all these amazing looks and the Lady Dior bag.” It was only natural, then, that Kapoor turn out for the label’s latest couture presentation. Besides, she can’t get enough of the City of Light either. “I love Paris, it’s such a nice place to be if you’re an artist,” she says. “I love to go to the museums. My favorite is the d’Orsay. I always get inspired, and every time I go there, I feel different.” After finishing hair and makeup, and taking a quick break to order room service—French fries, naturally!—Kapoor was ready to slip into her showtime look. The Indian star is styled by her sister, Rhea Kapoor, and together, they landed on a classic look including a netted black dress and faux fur coat.  “It’s draped really wonderfully,” Kapoor said of the dress. “It reminds me of an Indian outfit, but it’s not. It’s sexy, and very sporty and cool at the same time.”  The Kapoor sisters punctuated the look with traditional Indian accessories, such as Sahara earrings and black gajra hair flowers. When it comes to finding those perfect red carpet looks, both Rhea and Sonam agree: Their mother, a former model and fashion designer, serves as their forever style inspiration. “Sonam’s personal style has always been exuberant and joyful,” says Rhea. “She really has an appreciation for everything that goes into making a moment; I think that came from my mom.” Above, watch Kapoor’s full getting-ready video.

Paging All Denim Lovers! Levi’s Is Introducing Its Most Premium Line Yet,https://www.vogue.com/article/levis-blue-tab-denim-collection-launch,"January 30, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"For serious denim collectors, wearing a certain Levi’s tab can be the ultimate status symbol. The label’s Orange tab, for one, is a holy grail for 1960s-era flared jeans; the Silver tab reflects grungier styles from the 1980s and 1990s. Some Red tabs, featuring a rare capital “E” on the word “Levi’s,” have even sold for a whopping $6,000 online. Each tab the iconic denim brand releases, garners its own devoted cult following. And now, Levi’s is releasing a brand new one—its most premium tab yet. Dubbed the Blue Tab, the new collection releases on February 1 in Japan, and will arrive in the U.S. in April. The new Blue tab features premium Japanese selvedge denims, and serves up more elevated, modern silhouettes. Pieces in the line—which were photographed in a campaign by Juergen Teller at a traditional Japanese tea house—retail from $78 to $398, a slightly higher price point for the brand. Of course, made-in-Japan jeans are nothing new for Levi’s. For years now, the Levi’s Vintage Clothing line has been producing select styles in Japan. Now, the label is building on that expertise. “We have a long history working with Japan, and we wanted to give that a collection,” says Paul O’Neill, Levi’s design director. While the product is rooted in Japanese craft, the pieces still evoke that signature Levi’s Americana. “We wanted something contemporary, relevant, and on-trend,” says O’Neill. “The Blue Tab is a more sophisticated denim look.” What sets the Blue Tab apart from other Levi’s offerings is best noticed behind-the-scenes. All of the Blue Tab pieces are produced in Japan’s Kaihara Denim Mill, the same factory that has been producing some of its Vintage line for years. “We knew their expertise and how good they were, and they were open to doing more experimental stuff with us,” says O’Neill. “The Japanese are really becoming leaders in the denim industry when it comes to construction, beautiful fabrications, and amazing washes.” At the Japanese factory, the pieces go through a slower, more laborious production process than other pairs, via a variety of hand touches such as dyeing process, and distressing. (Even its classic styles, like the 502 and 511 jeans, have been re-worked in new fabrications.) “We used special dye and spinning techniques to create these irregularities [in the selvedge jeans],” says O’Neill. “People like selvedge denim because it’s traditional—it’s historic. Up until the 1980s, it was the only way denim was made; Selvedge denim was made on a shuttle loom, which is a much slower process.” The new, revamped Blue Tab logo takes inspiration from the Levi’s archives—drawing inspiration from typography found on a 1925 stock issuance certificate. In addition to the hand-crafted fabrication, the Blue Tab collection also branches out from just jeans, also offering jackets, blazers, chambray shirting, and dresses that can all be mix-and-matched. Longtime Levi’s fans may be surprised to find dressier staples in the mix, like a denim blazer, or a powder-blue Scout jacket or utility dresses. “We wanted to create a head-to-toe look with the product,” says O’Neill. “Breaking out of the confinesof what is expected from classic Levi's denim pieces—trying to bring denim into a new environment, or a different occasion.” Many of the pieces, unsurprisingly, took inspiration from Japanese street style, and the effortless way that locals piece an outfit together. “We were definitely interested in how they wear certain lengths and proportions,” says O’Neill. “Everything is very considered, even down the copper and silver buttons. We were always thinking about ways to elevate.” For diehard denim lovers, then, the new Levi’s tab may not be the splashiest, but that’s intentional. Instead of offering groundbreaking silhouettes or avant-garde opieces, the label is banking on a true love for the jean-making process. “The classic red tab was designed so people could see a pair of Levi’s from across the room. Now, you kind of have to look twice here,” says O’Neill. “I like that.” Does the design director see the Blue Tab having the same kind of cult following as, say, the Orange or White tabs? “I hope so, yeah. That'd be cool.” More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

"Happy Birthday, Tyla! Revisit Her Naughties Pop Star Style",https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/tyla-naughties-pop-star-style,"January 30, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Tyla may not have been alive during the original Y2K era, but she is more than capable of reviving the trend. While the “Water” singer is known for her distinctive South African-inspired sound, she has also honed a singular fashion sense. The singer’s style can be defined, first and foremost, by its sexiness. Tyla has simply never met a cutout, animal print, or thigh-high slit she didn’t like. She’s quickly become a muse for designers, like with the Balmain sand sculpture (made of actual sand) she wore to the 2024 Met Gala or the mint green crystal netted Atelier Versace number she wore to her first Grammys—where she took home the award for Best African Music Performance. But she’s also become a serious player in the vintage game, too. At the 2024 CFDA Awards, Tyla mixed old and new, wearing a black lace minidress from Tom Ford’s spring 1996 collection for Gucci with a pair of brat green hotpants underneath. And for the 2024 BET Awards, she wore a fall 2004 Versace dress that ticked all of her boxes: the black floor-length gown featured a hip-high slit, plunging cutout, and yellow animal print train. While she tends to stay away from direct references with her naughties style, Tyla did pay homage to Aaliyah with the blue tiger-striped Roberto Cavalli dress she wore to the MTV EMAs from the designer’s fall 2000 collection. In honor of Tyla’s birthday, take a look back at some of the singer’s best looks to date. At the Jacquemus fall 2025 show. In Balmain at the 2024 Met Gala. Performing in custom Michelle Hébert in Times Square on New Year’s Eve. In Louis Vuitton at the Prelude to the 2024 Paris Olympics. In spring 1996 Gucci at the 2024 CFDA Awards.

The Touching Meaning Behind Kate Middleton’s Pearls,https://www.vogue.com/article/kate-middleton-princess-of-wales-pearls,"January 30, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"The Princess and Prince of Wales participated in their first joint royal engagement of the year on January 27. They took part in a commemoration ceremony in London to honor Holocaust Memorial Day, on the 8th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau. It was also one of Kate Middleton’s first public appearances in a slow, considered return to royal life following her remission from cancer. Catherine often chooses jewelry and accessories with a royal context and more emotive connections. Recently, she was photographed carrying bags by Asprey and Smythson, both heritage label brands beloved by Queen Elizabeth II. For the memorial day event, she wore a selection of jewelry with deeper, poignant meanings. The royal opted for Bahrain Pearl Drop earrings, which were a wedding gift to the late Queen from the Hakim of Bahrain. The Queen was often seen wearing them, and she would loan them to the younger royals including Princess Diana and the then-Countess of Wessex Sophie. It appears that they were later gifted to Kate to keep; she wore the earrings for Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip’s 70th wedding anniversary, and both the late Queen and Prince’s funerals in 2021 and 2022. Kate also debuted a new piece: a vintage, five-strand pearl Susan Caplan necklace. The brand posted to celebrate the moment on Instagram: “Today marks 80 years since the Holocaust, and as a Jewish owned brand we are honored that the Princess of Wales chose to wear our necklace for today’s memorial to commemorate Holocaust Remembrance Day.” She also wore another poignant set of pearls in the form of a three-strand bracelet once owned by Princess Diana, who wore the piece in some of the most iconic images taken of her. She was photographed wearing the bracelet and her ‘Elvis’ dress for the 1989 tour of Hong Kong with the yet-to-be-king Charles. The bracelet was passed onto Prince William after Diana’s death. Kate has worn it on multiple tours and engagements. Pearls are significant for the royal family as mourning jewelry, and strongly associated with moments of grief, worn as a sign of deep respect. Kate dressed solemnly in all black: a black shirt, black wide-leg Rolan Mouret pants, black pumps, and a Catherine Walker coat, as well as a quilted Chanel bag. She was joined by Prince William and they met Holocaust survivors. Two such survivors were Steven Frank and Yvonne Bernstein, who were photographed by the princess with their grandchildren back in 2020. “A solemn moment of remembrance and hope for the future at today’s Holocaust Memorial Day service,” the couple wrote on their official royal social media. “Honored to take part in this important event to commemorate the lives lost in the Holocaust and other genocides.” More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

"Hailey Bieber Revives the Babushka Scarf Trend, Because Needs Must",https://www.vogue.com/article/hailey-bieber-bonnet-scarf,"January 30, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"It hasn’t been long since Hailey Bieber has returned from the fashion-off that was Aspen, where she spent the start of 2025 après-skiing and hitting the slopes with husband Justin Bieber, cozying up in sumptuous faux fur with Kendall and Kylie Jenner, and heading out for dinner pantsless. But Bieber is back in New York and very much back to work promoting her new Rhode lip product. Stepping out in the city yesterday (January 29), Bieber made the dash through Union Square in a functional yet fashionable fit. She kept to neutral tones and some signature pieces, wearing an oversized beige trench and matching low-rise suit trousers, with a grey button-up cardigan and white t-shirt underneath. She also wore her go-to black penny loafers, a chocolate brown shoulder bag and sunglasses, and chose a grey cashmere scarf to wrap around her shoulders. But needs must when you’re battling that New York chill: As the weather got stormier, Bieber revealed her shoulder-draping scarf to be a bonnet. Babushka Bieber has arrived—though it’s probably more a sartorial decision to lean into the old Hollywood glamor aesthetic of the headgear, a la Audrey Hepburn or Louise Brooks. Celebrities from Kendall Jenner, to Chloë Sevigny and Marc Jacobs are also purveyors of the bonnet. Bieber keeps her winter wardrobe winning. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

I Simply Cannot Stop Watching Videos of Strangers Buying Birkin Bags,https://www.vogue.com/article/love-luxury-tik-tok-birkin-bags,"January 29, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"We all have cheeky little pre-bedtime rituals that we do in the shadows. Perhaps you make it a mission to read a chapter or two of a book before dozing off into dreamland. Or perhaps you mindlessly scroll on TikTok instead, further feeding into your freakily-good algorithm until your eyelids close. Me, I have a more specific habit that I enjoy doing night after night: I take great delight in watching complete strangers buy a Birkin bag. Now, can I afford a luxurious Hermès Birkin, which can go for upwards of $40,000 (with some priced in the six figures)? Absolutely not. My budget is more aligned with the Wirkin (look it up). But even so, for the past few months, I have obsessively watched countless well-off customers treat themselves to a Birkin bag on LoveLuxury’s TikTok page, where the sale exchanges are theatrically filmed as skits for our viewing pleasure. (LoveLuxury is a secondhand store with locations in London and Dubai, both fast becoming a destination for rare and luxurious bags.) This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. If you need me in the evenings, you can now find me in bed, watching as a new customer enters the boutique and shops for a new Birkin to celebrate their birthday or promotion. (One customer purchased the aspirational accessory to celebrate marrying a millionaire—goals.) Sure, I cannot relate to the interactions, but night after night, I have found that I can fantasize about choosing between gold or palladium hardware, or weigh the pros and cons of a Birkin 25 versus a Birkin 30. (Me, personally? Birkin 30, all the way). It has become my twisted little form of evening escapism. There is a sense of joy and entertainment, after all, in trying to relate to the one percent. “This is a bit too gray,” one client will say, doubting a perfectly-chic neutral Birkin. Ah, yes, I will agree. Far too gray-hued. “I’m not so sure this will go with many different outfits,” another will ponder of a two-tone style, while I shake my head in agreement. Too trendy. Who am I to act so discerning? If I were ever to be offered a Birkin, in any shape or color, I would simply take it and run for the hills. (You can sell that baby in five years, and make a serious return!) This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. But that’s not the point of these videos, is it? As LoveLuxury’s 3.5 million TikTok followers can attest to, there is something highly addicting about seeing what rare and beautiful Birkin bags remain to be discovered out there—and what levels people will go to get them. I do not know these shoppers, but I feel happy for them, being able to treat themselves as a way to mark a serious milestone. Plus, there are worse bedtime habits to partake in, no? I’m simply shopping with my eyes; I’m not harming anyone! Well, maybe just my own Birken-less self-esteem. But maybe one day, I will find myself on this exact same TikTok page, ready to buy myself one. Until then: If anyone would like to send me a Brikin 30 in black with palladium hardware, the lines are open!

Step Inside Alessandro Michele’s Valentino Atelier Ahead of His First Couture Show,https://www.vogue.com/article/inside-the-atelier-alessandro-michele-valentino-couture-spring-2025,"January 29, 2025",By Hannah Jackson," Just a few days before Alessandro Michele’s inaugural Valentino couture show, the Italian designer welcomed Vogue into one of the house's five Paris ateliers, where master seamstresses were hard at work putting the finishing touches on his otherworldly designs. “Like every beginning it’s beautiful, it’s exciting, but it’s also stressful,” Michele says of his foray into couture. “The collection is an incredible—for me—exercise of creativity.” The world of couture was brand new for Michele, who focused on ready-to-wear during his time as creative director at Gucci. “They work by themselves in a very also secret way that is very fascinating,” he says of the members of his atelier and their intricate process for creating pieces of couture by hand. “I feel myself that I’m learning because this is so different than from being just a fashion designer. I’ve never seen something like this in my life.” When approaching the collection, Michele wanted to consider the world that Mr. Valentino himself inhabited when he helmed the house. The golden age of Italian film served as a major influence—specifically the Cinecittà studio and the works of Luchino Visconti and Frederico Fellini. But while he considers Mr. Valentino’s life experience, Michele views his first couture collection as a conversation between the two of them. “His presence is so big. You must find your way,” Michele says. It was of the utmost importance for Michele that his own perspective harmonized with the Valentino house codes. “I think that Mr. Valentino means, for many people, a kind of classical beauty,” he says. “My way to approach beauty is more sauvage. I like the wrong things that became beautiful.” The fantastical nature of Michele’s couture—the grandeur, the opulence, even the humor—isn’t lost on him in a particularly dark political moment. “I hope that people are going to leave the room stronger than before.” Watch here as Alessandro Michele takes Vogue inside the Valentino atelier ahead of his couture spring 2025 collection.

Rihanna’s Double Denim Winter Styling Is On Point,https://www.vogue.com/article/rihanna-double-denim-winter-styling,"January 29, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"There are few trends and pieces that Rihanna cannot pull off (if any). The superstar will double up on wild animal prints as though they're neutrals, or effortlessly wear a big fuzzy chapeau like it’s an ordinary baseball cap. That’s simply the Riri effect: She can make even the most daring fashion seem totally wearable. Her latest styling win? The singer and business mogul was spotted out in Los Angeles last night with A$AP Rocky, doubled up on denim. Her approach to the Canadian Tuxedo—that’s a denim jacket up top, and classic straight-leg jeans on the bottom—was totally on point for the winter, thanks to the addition of an oversized leather trench coat. It’s all very The Matrix—if Trinity was in tune with the latest runway trends. Rihanna's accessories—a saucy pair of snakeskin boots and bold framed specs—added to the look: they felt cool and nonchalant way, giving hints of country-western style in a non-cheesy way. Call us crazy, but there is something special about donning a Canadian Tuxedo versus a full on two-piece suit. (Though Rocky, by her side, went all-in on traditional tailoring and looked great.) Rihanna makes a strong case for dressing casual for date night. Why be stuffy, when you can just pile on the jeans? Should you want to try the look, consider the Riri approach and pair your denim pieces with elevated accessories: you’re going for high-fashion, not hoedown.

The Best Dressed Stars at Spring 2025 Couture Week,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/best-dressed-stars-couture-week-spring-2025,"January 29, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Fashion spectators, rejoice: Couture week has arrived! The spring 2025 haute couture collections have officially kicked off in Paris, with labels such as Schiaparelli and Christian Dior ushering in the first day of shows. Given it is a week focused on showcasing the finest craftsmanship and innovation that ateliers have to offer, it’s no surprise that the affair draws an A-list crowd in the front rows—all of whom match the elevated fashion energy with their own exquisite, elaborate looks. Some of the stylish celebrity sightings seen thus far? At Dior, stars leaned into the polished and elegant wears; Jenna Ortega styled a structured blazer with micro shorts, tights, and leather opera gloves, while Anya Taylor-Joy embraced a strappy fringed dress. At Schiaparelli, Regina King completed her crisp white suit with one of the label’s surreal face bags, while model Kendall Jenner—who walked the runway—emerged post-show in a brown leather blazer coat, complete with a suede Hermès Birkin bag to match. There are plenty more couture shows to come, so be sure to check back on this post, and see all of the A-list action as it unfolds in real time. Below, explore the best dressed stars at couture week.

"Kylie Jenner Talks Becoming a Chanel Girl, and What She Loved About the Couture Show",https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/kylie-jenner-chanel-couture-paris-fashion-week,"January 29, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Kylie Jenner is no stranger to sitting front row at fashion week. Over the years, the reality star has been a staple VIP guest during the shows (along with the rest of the Kardashian-Jenner clan) but that doesn’t mean she’s seen and done it all. In fact, on Tuesday morning, Jenner marked her very first time attending a Chanel couture show in Paris—touching down in the City of Light to take in the French label’s new spring 2025 couture collection. “It was beautiful,” Jenner tells Vogue of the presentation, which also saw stars like Dua Lipa and Jennie turn out for the affair. “My favorite look in the show was this striking red dress. The most perfect shade of red, and just really took my breath away. Gorgeous as always.” Naturally, Jenner transformed into a total Chanel girl for the occasion. (It is couture week, after all—a statement look is mandatory.) She opted for an ecru, black, blue, and red jacket and skirt in the house’s classic tweed. Jenner modernized the look with a cropped jacket and mini skirt silhouette. “I loved my look so much. I felt beautiful and feminine,” says Jenner. “And my favorite detail was the accessories.” The layered chain belts, slingback heels, and quilted box bag were indeed enviable. “Chanel has an incredible ability to make you feel timeless yet modern at the same time,” says Jenner, whose Chanel collection is so expansive it even includes athleisure. “Every piece tells a story, and there’s always a balance between elegance and edge that resonates with me. It’s not just about the clothes—it’s the craftsmanship, the legacy, and how they make you feel when you wear them. That’s what keeps me coming back.” As for the rest of Jenner’s plans during Paris couture week, you can expect her to indulge—in more ways than one. “I always make time for fashion shows, of course, and good food and friends,” she says. Is there a better combination than French food and style? Deux baguettes, s’il-vous-plait! Below, see exclusive photos from Jenner’s Chanel show day.

"Demi Moore Takes Paris, Dressed Like the Award Statuette She Deserves",https://www.vogue.com/article/demi-moore-paris-fashion-week-armani,"January 29, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Couture week is in full swing in Paris, and the celebrities have been storming the streets in their very best. Jennie had her own twist to the naked dressing trend, Kylie Jenner cropped her tweeds, and Dua Lipa brought her biggest hairbow to Chanel. Schiaparelli attendees—from Regina King to Kelly Rutherford—opted for crisp, winter whites, while Jenna Ortega and Anya Taylor-Joy went hell for leather for Dior. Demi Moore, however, is staying true to her campaign trail wardrobe. The very recent first-time Academy Award nominee stepped out in Paris for the Armani Privé spring 2025 show, dressed like a sleek, gilded statuette. The Substance actor wore a stiff, nipped in metallic Armani jacket with a sculpted peplum waist, black velvet trousers, and Louboutin stilettos. She accessorized with a stacked, layered black beaded necklace, and wore a pop of cherry red on her nails to match her red-bottomed shoes. Right beside her was her longtime stylist, Brad Goreski, who has surely been taking in what showstopping sparklers from fashion week he can pull for Moore next. It was a special evening, regardless, to be dressed like a trophy. The show marked 20 years of Giorgio Armani’s haute couture line Armani Privé, calling upon Armani’s most celebrated aesthetics and technical elements: shimmering, crystal-studded gowns, silky tailoring, jewel tones. Others on the front row with Moore included Jessica Biel and Dianna Agron, who joined in the rapturous applause for the legendary 90-year-old designer. Moore wore a custom gold, structured Armani Privé dress with rhinestone panelling and an exaggerated mermaid tail to The Golden Globes, where she picked up her first best actress award and gave a rousing speech. Next is Critics Choice, BAFTA, and the SAG awards. As a current forerunner for the Oscars nod, Ms Demi Moore could be picking up her first Academy Award in one of the metallic Armani dream gowns that graced the 8th arrondissement last night.

Kylie Jenner Channels Her Inner Cheetah Girl,https://www.vogue.com/article/kylie-jenner-channels-her-inner-cheetah-girl,"January 28, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Kendall Jenner has amassed an impressive vintage Alaïa collection, but now her younger sister Kylie Jenner might be coming for her crown. After the Chanel couture show in Paris, Kylie changed from her cropped white tweed skirt set into a polar opposite look for lunch at Bar des Prés. The reality star opted for a skintight mock neck minidress with sheer cheetah print paneling and black velvet cups. The skirt, also made of black velvet, featured a paneled hem. The dress hails from Azzedine Alaïa’s fall 1991 collection, filled with animalistic prints ranging from butterflies to leopards. Kylie paired her vintage dress with a current season shoe—a black patent leather round-toe Alaïa mule. In case you’re wondering how the Cheetah Girls would’ve dressed in 2025, consider this your answer. Kylie Jenner in Paris. Yasmeen Ghauri, Alaïa fall 1991 Nadège du Bospertus, Alaïa fall 1991 Kylie, as she’s wont to do, opted for one of the sexier pieces from the collection. While her dress didn’t walk the runway, Yasmeen Ghauri, Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer, Nadège du Bospertus, and Beverly Peele all wore similarly sheer looks with cutout breasts. It’s a much different approach to vintage Alaïa than her sister Kendall has taken with the storied French house. Like Kylie, Kendall embraced Alaïa’s silhouettes. But while Kylie is all in on the ultra-sexy bodycon, Kendall used the house to live out her Emily In Paris dreams. In September, the elder Jenner sister wore a boxy gray plaid jacket with a nipped-in waist from the fall 1988 collection. And in June 2023, she wore an off-white minidress with a similarly cinched waist and a flared skirt. Between Kendall and Kylie Jenner, it seems that there’s more than enough vintage Alaïa to go around.

Reese Witherspoon Champions the Return of This Classic It Bag,https://www.vogue.com/article/reese-witherspoon-it-bag-return,"January 28, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Nowadays it seems like every fashion house is in an arms race for an It bag—the Bottega Andiamo, the Miu Miu Aventure, the Alaïa Le Teckel… But Reese Witherspoon would rather return to a time-honored classic: the Fendi Peekaboo. The actor carried a medium black Peekaboo in the crook of her elbow, a crossbody strap emblazoned with the telltale double-F Fendi logo hanging down beside her. The orange and black strap offered a subtle pop of color against Witherspoon’s all-black outfit. Keeping warm, she bundled up in a modular Marfa Stance jacket, a reversible collarless knee-length coat. While its other side is a quilted parka, she opted to wear the black wool side facing out, cinching her waist with a sash. Underneath her coat, Witherspoon wore an ankle-length black skirt and leather round-toe boots. She finished off her all-black look with black oval sunglasses and small gold hoop earrings. Reese Witherspoon in New York. It’s somewhat surprising that—given the recent cultural obsession with Hermès bags and belted silhouettes in general—the Fendi Peekaboo isn’t more popular. It has the if-you-know-you-know appeal and the fashion legacy, without feeling overexposed. If anything, Reese Witherspoon is making a strong push for its return.

We may earn an affiliate commission from links. When it comes to her mom-to-be wardrobe, Jennifer Lawrence is embracing her inner dad. Today, the actor and her husband, art gallery director Cooke Maroney, ventured to The Row store on the Upper East Side. Lawrence—dressing for both the freezing temperatures and the twilight of her pregnancy—kept it comfortable in lots of layers. Over a white T-shirt, she wore a blue gingham button-up, which she paired with white under-the-bump sweatpants. She bundled up in a black wool coat and added a white scarf with a dainty multicolored pattern. But it was Lawrence’s shoe choice that demanded the most attention. With a pair of mustard yellow socks, she wore chunky New Balance 1906R x Aime Leon Dore sneakers in mint green and black. While she’s the quintessential Upper West Side mom, in her chunky ALD New Balances, Lawrence was dressing the part of a Lower East Side dad. Jennifer Lawrence in New York. Margot Robbie in June 2024. Jennifer Lawrence isn’t the only celebrity mom to add dad sneakers to their maternity wardrobe lately. Margot Robbie, who welcomed her first child with husband Tom Ackerley in October, also included the statement sneaks in her repertoire. In June, the actor accessorized an oversized beige suit with a pair of equally large New Balances. Perhaps these two know that the key to maternity style was in dad’s closet all along.

Melania Trump Cosplays The Apprentice in Her Official White House Portrait,https://www.vogue.com/article/melania-trump-official-white-house-portrait-the-apprentice-cosplay,"January 28, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"The White House has unveiled first lady Melania Trump’s official portrait. The sober black-and-white photograph by Régine Mahaux features Trump, the Washington Monument towering over her shoulder, resting her fingers on a reflective black desk and staring down the camera as if to say, “You’re fired.” Indeed, Trump looked more like she was guest starring on an episode of The Apprentice than assuming the role of first lady of the United States. Trump’s clothing certainly didn’t help the boardroom pastiche. The first lady wore a black Dolce & Gabbana tuxedo jacket with satin-trimmed lapels over a white button-up, which she paired with a Ralph Lauren cummerbund and trousers. The choice to wear a tuxedo—as opposed to a blazer or blouse—made Trump look more like a freelance magician than a public servant. It’s perhaps unsurprising that a woman who lived in a gold-encrusted penthouse, whose fame is so intertwined with a reality-television empire, would refuse to abandon theatrics—even when faced with 248 years of tradition. Melania Trump’s 2017 White House portrait The photograph is noticeably more toned down than her 2017 White House portrait, also taken by Mahaux. Unlike the new black-and-white image, Trump’s first portrait was in color, featuring the first lady—face airbrushed into oblivion—wide-eyed, smiling with a hint of teeth, her arms crossed to display a massive diamond wedding ring. This time, while the portrait remains more subdued, the Trumps are displaying wealth not through diamond rings but through the coterie of tech CEOs who sat in the front row at the 2025 inauguration, whose combined net worth was over a trillion dollars. Trump regularly sends messages with her clothing choices. In 2018, en route to visit children (some of whom were separated from their parents by the Trump administration) held in a migrant detention center in McAllen, Texas, the first lady wore a Zara jacket with the message “I Really Don’t Care, Do U?” emblazoned on the back. She also earned criticism for the pink pussy-bow blouse she wore to a debate between her husband and Hillary Clinton in 2016 after his infamous “grab ’em by the pussy” tape was released. Now, attempting a no-nonsense businesswoman approach in her situationally inappropriate tuxedo, it seems that Melania Trump still struggles with sartorial messaging.

The Best Celebrity Sightings From the 2025 Sundance Film Festival,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/2025-sundance-film-festival-fashion-red-carpet,"January 28, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"While 2025’s awards season continues on, Hollywood A-listers are now touching down in Park City, Utah for the annual Sundance Film Festival. The event, which will run until February 2, is showcasing a particularly buzzworthy list this year. The star-studded event serves as the perfect lead-up to the 2025 Oscars, which is fast approaching on March 2. The Sundance Film Festival is an affair unlike any other, of course: Compared to the glitzy Cannes or Venice film festivals, the Sundance red carpets are all about embracing a more intimate, cozy vibe, with celebrities dipping into their best wintery wardrobes. Vogue is rounding up all of the best celebrity sightings here. Highlights thus far: Stars like Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Erivo, and Rachel Sennott have made appearances in their best statement outerwear. There has been plenty of internet boyfriends in the mix, too, with names like Logan Lerman, Josh O’Connor, and Callum Turner bringing their best layered looks to the red carpet. The good news is: We still have a week of premieres and screenings to look forward to, so be sure to check back for all of the daily sightings.

Readymade Meets Ready-To-Wear: Gallery Dept. By Josué Thomas Exhibits in Paris,https://www.vogue.com/article/readymade-meets-ready-to-wear-gallery-dept-by-josue-thomas-exhibits-in-paris,"January 28, 2025",By Luke Leitch,"“People say, ‘Oh, you’re a designer.’ And, yes, I design. But I’m an artist first.” Hearing this statement at a first-time Fashion Week showroom appointment would usually have me mentally rolling my eyes, framing my excuses, and edging toward the door. Coming from Josué Thomas on the last afternoon of his debut stand-alone Paris presentation, however, it computed. The reason for this was neither the easel we were standing next to nor the paint-spattered suiting tailored from Thomas’s twill drop cloths on the racks in the hall of this fancy apartment behind Avenue Montaigne. It was more that Thomas’s approach to streetwear, when the very term streetwear in fashion has become freighted with semiotic shade, is so elevating: He sees it as art. Because who’s to say it can’t be? A look from the collection. Photo: Courtesy of Gallery Dept A look from the collection. Photo: Courtesy of Gallery Dept Gallery Dept. was founded by Los Angeles–born Thomas, now 40, back in 2016. He started out by reworking vintage pieces on a made-to-order basis, deconstructing then reconstructing, and typically marking the garments with paint. For a while, around 2018 or so, his “L.A. flare”–reworked Levi’s and Carhartts became a silhouette-shifting sensation. In 2020, Virgil Abloh told The New York Times: “I see Josué as making a new canon of his own, showcasing what Black design can do.” As for those flares, Abloh called them “the most important new cut of denim in the last decade since the skinny jean.” More recently, there have been merch collaborations with Migos, Lanvin, and the ubiquitous Ugg. Photographed by Luke Leitch Thomas has been to Paris to pitch to buyers in multi-brand showrooms before, but this season’s re-creation of his home studio (Thomas is now based in Miami but worked out of Paris all last summer) comes at a moment of planned expansion. He has taken an apartment in the French capital and hopes to establish an outpost in Milan imminently too. He added, “There is going to be more editorial and look books, more storytelling and expression. And now we are working on having a runway show next year.” Attempts to intersect art and fashion are often sunk on the perilous triple-pronged reef of discipline snobbery, commercial cringe, and vanity shaming. Thomas seems nicely placed to challenge these prejudices: “The work we’ve been putting in, and what it is and what it’s evolved into—it needs the light of day a bit. It’s been a natural, truthful, honest evolution.” Photographed by Luke Leitch Photographed by Luke Leitch A closer look at some of the pieces from the collection.

Forget the Naked Dress—Jennie Brings a Naked Cape to Couture Week,https://www.vogue.com/article/jennie-chanel-couture-week-cape,"January 28, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Is there a more star-studded show during couture week than Chanel? Arguable! Every season, the French label draws an A-list crowd of attendees, and this morning’s presentation at the Grand Palais was certainly no different. Celebrities in the front row included Dua Lipa, Lily Rose-Depp, Kylie Jenner, Pamela Anderson, and Jennie—talk about a VIP crowd! Of course, each star was sure to slip into their finest Chanel looks for the occasion (couture week is all about extravagance, after all). However, it was Jennie who stole the show with her chic powder-blue cape and trousers styling. And her daring look nodded to one of the biggest fashion movements of the moment. Over the past year, the naked dress—silhouettes that are totally sheer, exposing the form underneath–have taken over the red carpets. Celebrities have been unafraid to show some skin, and Jennie’s styling of the cape—worn without a top underneath, safe for a tasteful body chain—nodded to the trend in an elegant way, especially when styled with black dress pants. Clearly, the naked trend is not leaving us anytime soon, but Jennie’s elevated treatment of the look shows promise for a 2025 evolution. Perhaps this year will be less about the all-exposing gown, and more about giving structured pieces—jackets, capes, blazers—a sexier spin by forgoing a shirt with them. Prepare yourself for the fashion movement, because when Jennie embraces something, it usually takes off rather quickly. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Let a Pair of Zany Sunglasses Revive Your Winter Style,https://www.vogue.com/article/let-a-pair-of-zany-sunglasses-revive-your-winter-style,"January 28, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Getting dressed on a frigid winter morning is…a task. Dreary weather begets dreary outfits—grays and blacks to the front. While dressing for cold weather can often leave us sacrificing fashion for warmth, celebrities like Timothée Chalamet, Gwendoline Christie, and Michelle Yeoh have all recently leaned on a replicable style trick: over-the-top sunglasses. Adding a pair of bold sunnies is a shortcut to spicing up a toned-down look. Perhaps nobody knows this better than Chalamet, whose A Complete Unknown press tour style has been defined by its accessories. Sure, Chalamet has been all in on scarves lately, but let’s not overlook his commitment to outré eyewear. At a photocall in Rome, he accessorized an umber suit and white button-down with a pair of futuristic amber-toned Prada sunglasses. He didn’t stop there. On Saturday night, during his double duty shift as host and musical guest on SNL, he took the stage in a black anorak, black pants, and oversized bug-eye sunglasses. Timothée Chalamet performing on SNL. Christie, like Chalamet, used her accessories to add some pizzaz to a simpler look. While out in New York, she wore a double-breasted camel coat over a black dress, letting the rest of her look do the talking. Although her school bus yellow Prada heels and fringed purse were certainly eye-catching, Christie’s geometric ’60s-inspired glasses upgrade even the most basic outfit. For Yeoh, sunglasses served as a tool to elevate an already funky look. The Balenciaga ambassador wore a pair of the house’s bug-eyed shades to accessorize a black coat with extreme shoulder pads and green scaley silk-satin pants. Gwendoline Christie in New York. Michelle Yeoh in New York. So whether you’re dressing down or looking to add an extra wow-factor to a winter outfit, take a page out of Timothée Chalamet, Gwendoline Christie, and Michelle Yeoh’s books and add on a pair of statement sunglasses.

"On the Podcast: Alessandro Michele Discusses His New Life at Valentino—“I Felt Myself Like in the Middle of a Poem, a Novel, a Book”",https://www.vogue.com/article/on-the-podcast-alessandro-michele-valentino,"January 28, 2025",By Laia Garcia-Furtado,"“This is not really ‘a brand.’ You really feel that everything started from the Haute Couture. It’s almost everywhere; the shadow of that culture, snaking in every corridor, room, hands, brain, people here work differently. The salon is full of incredible people, it’s like every single person is like a little wizard, something magical, and everything is under a spell. Time doesn’t exist. The ritual of making is completely different.” The above quote could only come from Alessandro Michele, who joins Nicole Phelps on this episode of The Run-Through for a formidable conversation about his new life chez Valentino. Last year, the beloved and influential designer was appointed the new creative director at the Roman house, where for the first time he will also be in charge of a couture collection. Michele previously spent 20 years at Gucci, the last eight as creative director, where his maximalist, egalitarian vision of beauty was culture-shifting. Beyond his prowess as a designer, Michele is a thinker, and truly one of the most interesting people in the industry. You won’t want to miss him talking about his approach to creativity, why he styles his own collections, how he seeks and keeps joy in the world, and why he thinks “fashion can build a better, dreamy place.” More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

"From Winter Whites to Emily in Paris–Inspired Berets, 9 Street Style Trends From the Fall 2025 Menswear Shows",https://www.vogue.com/article/9-street-style-trends-from-the-fall-2025-menswear-shows,"January 28, 2025",By Irene Kim,"After 12 days of men’s shows, we’ve finally come to the end of part one of the fashion marathon. An important lesson learned this season is that it’s not just Gen Z types who are channeling their inner Emily in Paris and sporting a beret; all manner of street stylers are choosing this very French essential to keep warm. And it’s necessary for a reason: Whether in denim, wool, or even fur, the chapeau always looks très chic. While it used to be that no one wore white after Labor Day, rules were made to be broken, and in Europe winter whites managed to brighten up the streets even on the cloudiest days. It was cold and rainy in London, Milan, and Paris, but attendees took it as an opportunity to show off their most opulent shearlings and eye-catching garments, like Yu Masui’s bold flame print. Scroll through to discover nine standout street style trends from the fall 2025 menswear shows below. A beret is a classic for a reason! As the saying goes, when in Paris…do as the French do.

Attending a Louis Vuitton Show One Day and Playing an NBA Game the Next: How Jeremy Sochan Did Paris,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/jeremy-sochan-paris-fashion-week,"January 27, 2025",By Leah Faye Cooper,"Growing up between Poland and the United States, NBA star Jeremy Sochan took a handful of trips to Paris to play French basketball teams. For the most part, the visits weren’t all that memorable, but unbeknownst to him at the time, one would prove to be rather significant. “One of the times I came to Paris as a kid was with the Polish National Team, and we actually played against Victor [Wembanyama],” Sochan tells Vogue, recalling a matchup with his current San Antonio Spurs teammate. “It’s so cool to think about now that it’s come full-circle—not only playing on the same team, but also both being back in Paris and getting to play here together.” In May, when the NBA announced that the Spurs would face the Indiana Pacers for two games in Paris this season, “my eyes lit up, for sure,” Sochan says. “It was a dream, for real. And then finding out it was during fashion week, it [was] just mad.” Sochan is among the bevy of current NBA players as celebrated for their style as for their on-court talents. His wardrobe—a mix of Lardini suits, Rick Owens separates, and cozy Alo sweats—complements his ever-changing hair color. (For Paris, he went with an aqua-like blue-green mix.) Last week, Sochan arrived in Paris with a suitcase full of looks to see him through the men’s shows, sightseeing, and his pre-game tunnel walk at Paris’s Arcor arena. For the Louis Vuitton show, where his seat mates included Chris Paul, A$AP Nast, Future, and Travis Scott, “I wore a blazer with no shirt under, which let me show off my chest tattoo a little bit,” he says. He wore it with flared pants and glasses. Though “there’s nothing like our hometown crowd in San Antonio,” Sochan says, Paris fans brought their own kind of energy. “I think they were super excited because you never really see NBA games in Europe, so it was crazy from the get-go—from the moment we ran out for warm-ups. There were a bunch of Polish fans [and] lot of my family and friends came out, and that was special to me.” The highlight of the trip, however, was simply being in Europe. “It felt fresh. It felt good. The vibes were good,” Sochan says. “Having the blessing to play in the NBA and then playing in Europe is crazy.” Oh, and one more thing: “The pastries,” he says. “The baguettes, the pain au chocolates, the croissants—fire.” Here, Sochan shares photos from his time in Paris.

Kendall Jenner Road Tests the Latest Trends In Her Model-Off-Duty Style,https://www.vogue.com/article/kendall-jenner-road-tests-latest-trends-model-off-duty-style-couture-spring-2025,"January 27, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Couture week demands only the finest fashions and Kendall Jenner came ready to deliver. The model jetted to Paris to close out Daniel Roseberry’s Schiaparelli spring 2025 couture show in an opulent corseted gown. But off the runway, Jenner used her model-off-duty style to try out the latest trends. The night before the Schiaparelli show, Jenner embraced the latest emphasis on menswear, joining the likes of Hailey Bieber, Ayo Edebiri, and Mikey Madison in the new necktie craze. The model leaned into power clashing in Bottega Veneta, wearing a black and yellow striped button-up with a matching tie, underneath a plaid, double-breasted jacket with a cinched waist and wide sleeves. Jenner finished off the businesslike look with black trousers, loafers with white socks, and black sunglasses. Kendall Jenner in Paris, January 26 The following day, post-catwalk, Jenner tried out a different trend: double collars. Layered lapels have been all over the runway from Rabanne to The Row. A devoted fan to the latter, Jenner swapped her Schiaparelli couture for a lambskin leather blazer, which she wore over a plain white tee and black pants. Ever on-trend, she accessorized with a brown suede Hermès Kelly.

Inside Pro Athlete A'ja Wilson’s First Paris Fashion Week,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/aja-wilson-paris-fashion-week-diary,"January 27, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Given that the worlds of fashion and sport continue to intertwine—virtually every front row is filled with top athletes these days—it may be shocking to learn that last week marked basketball pro A'ja Wilson’s first time attending the shows in Paris. The Las Vegas Aces center made her debut in the City of Light by taking in the new fall 2025 mens collections, at shows such as KidSuper, Doublet, and Sacai—and invited Vogue along for all of the fashion fun. “I was thrilled to immerse myself in the fashion world,” Wilson says. “Paris holds a special place in my heart. I was here a few months ago and won an Olympic gold medal in this city, so returning brings back wonderful memories. And now experiencing fashion week adds another exciting layer.” Whereas her last trip to the city was filled with practice and competition, this one was all about style. “It’s an incredible opportunity to witness the creative visions of designers come to life through their clothing and runway presentations,” says Wilson, who always makes time to see the sights when she is in town. “The iconic Eiffel Tower is a must see when I come to Paris. It's hard to miss, but witnessing it sparkle at night is truly magical. I adore the city's fast paced atmosphere—and exquisite food!” Wilson’s highlights as she navigated the front rows for the first time? “The Doublet show was super dope,” says Wilson, who gravitated towards the dark, edgy suiting looks. Visiting with friends and peers was another treat. “I had the pleasure of dining at Siena with some amazing Nike athletes,” she says. Of course, given this was PFW, Wilson had to bring forward some of her own standout looks. As a VIP guest, she felt the pressure to deliver a statement wardrobe all week long—and totally delivered. “I aimed to wear something that stood out and made a statement, while also giving me that comfort and pop of confidence,” says Wilson. “I tried to give a little high fashion, while also showing my personal style with things like crop tops, asymmetrical skirts and sneakers—staying true to who I am.” The star says she defines her personal style as comfortable, yet chic, so her PFW looks struck that balance. She sported a structured two-piece set with a plushy fur coat, and an oversized skirt suit with chunky combat boots. “I loved the Sacai oversized fringed blazer [I wore,]” Wilson says of one of her favorite looks. She also nailed Parisian dressing by pairing a khaki trench coat with baggy cream trousers. “Lately, I’ve been gravitating toward bell-bottom wide-legged pants,” says Wilson. “They're really flattering and accentuate the length of my legs.” Wilson totally fit in with the fashionable A-list crowd during the week. But now, it’s time to focus on preparing for game day again. “In the coming month, I'll be training, as I prepare for my eighth WNBA season,” says Wilson. “Getting ready to chase another championship title!” She does, however, have a few fashion-minded projects in the works (she can’t totally leave her fashion identity behind.) “My first signature shoe and apparel collection with Nike is dropping this spring,” she teases, “and I'm excited to share that with everyone!” We can’t wait.

“Les Siciliennes Are Going to Paris”—Inside Dolce & Gabbana’s Impromptu Alta Moda Show,https://www.vogue.com/article/dolce-gabbana-alta-moda-paris-2025,"January 27, 2025",By Tiziana Cardini,"Fresh of the opening of their exhibition Du Coeur à la Main—which traces the magnificence of 10 years of their Alta Moda creations in the salons of the Grand Palais —Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce staged a défilé on the eve of couture week in Paris. It served as a sort of crowning touch, much like the finishing flourish on a Sicilian cassata, the traditional cake with icing that mirrors the pastel swirls of Palermo’s Baroque palazzos. “Les Siciliennes are going to Paris,” the designers said during a preview. By the opulent standards of their Dolce & Gabbana Alta Moda presentations—which typically involve several days of extravagant guest entertaining in Italian locations—the show was a more pared-down affair. Yet, held in the lavishly restored Hôtel de la Marine, it still highlighted their impressive range, offering a tour-de-force exploration of the many dimensions of their fétiche color—black. The enigmatic mystique of Sicilian culture lies at the heart of Stefano and Domenico’s oeuvre. The sacred and the profane, religious devotion and sensuality, simmering passion shrouded in a veil of composure and silence —these dramatic contrasts have shaped their repertoire from the outset, nearly 40 years ago. “We wanted to bring the authentic essence of who we are to Paris, the love for our homeland that is central to our work,” they explained. Quintessentially Italian, the show nonetheless read as their homage to La Ville Lumière and its haute couture tradition. “Showing here is a dream come true,” they shared. “We are deeply grateful and honored because we don’t see ourselves as couturiers, but as sarti, tailors with a passion for the beauty of the fatto a mano, the art of handmade craftsmanship. Sicily and Paris share a deep historical connection,” they explained. Although the French ruled the Kingdom of Sicily only briefly in the early 14th century, their influence left a lasting imprint on the region’s culture and way of life. Even today, traces of French can be found in the local dialect; the Palermitan aristocracy once spoke fluent French and frequently sent their chefs to Paris to master the art of haute cuisine. “To stand out against the unmatched Parisian flair for haute couture, the only option was to stay true to ourselves,” they reflected. And so, the Alta Moda Parigi collection was steeped in black as a counterpoint to the chic of the French capital: “Black is the ultimate symbol of Sicilian elegance, solemn yet extravagant, pure and alluring.” A “devotional procession from Palermo to the Ville Lumière,” the show unfolded as a reimagining of their most seductive best-ofs, embellished with intricate lace embroidery, encrustations, cut-outs, inlays, and Baroque golden appliqué, as well as boasting diverse silhouettes, from slender to sensuous to lavishly voluminous. It was a parade of somber black widows carrying rosaries and gold crosses pinned on cinched-waist belts, alluring femme fatales wrapped in embellished cocoons and theatrical capes, and coquettish ingénues, sporting corsets, lingerie, and fishnet stockings only barely veiled under sheer showstoppers. Attended mostly by devoted Dolce & Gabbana’s Alta Moda clients dressed to the nines in the designers’ latest creations, the show was followed by a lavish dinner at the Ritz, where Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, Catherine Deneuve, Eva Herzigova, and Monica Bellucci, with boyfriend Tim Burton in tow, fêted the designers, who cheerfully mingled late into the night.

Behold! Every Taylor Swift Outfit From the 2024-2025 NFL Season,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/every-taylor-swift-outfit-2024-2025-nfl-season,"January 26, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"It’s a Sunday evening in America, and that only means one thing: Taylor Swift is at the Kansas City Chiefs game. For the second season in a row, the singer is cheering on her boyfriend, Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce. Tonight, Swift was spotted attending the Chiefs-versus-Buffalo Bills game in a bold monogrammed Louis Vuitton look including a logo jacket, bag, and boots. Ever the supportive partner, Swift often comes decked out in team colors. On some occasions, she leans all the way into WAG territory (for the team’s game against the Bengals on September 15, she wore a Chiefs tee with thigh-high black boots), while on other nights she embraces her more high-fashion side, like the denim Versace corset top she wore for the game against the Baltimore Ravens. For a game against the New Orleans Saints, Swift turned out a full Vivienne Westwood ensemble, wearing an off-the-shoulder sweetheart corset and miniskirt in a matching gray-and-red tartan from fall 2024, which she paired with knee-high black leather platform boots and a small purse emblazoned with Westwood’s telltale orb insignia. (The corset has proven itself a particularly popular piece as of late: just last month former First Daughter Malia Obama also wore it to the Deauville Film Festival in France.) Beyond the fabulous fashion, she opted for a spirited beauty look, adding a smattering of glitter across her face to her signature red lip. Swift is also liable to mix sporty style with more fashion-forward elements. On the November 4 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, she paired her Kansas City leather jacket with a Dior Saddle bag and a Chanel necklace. On November 29, she stepped out for the Black Friday game in a red Louis Vuitton half-zip sweater, Dana Rebecca Designs hoops, and a custom “87” necklace in honor of Travis Kelce’s jersey number. Though, at the December 21 game against the Houston Texans, Swift channeled her inner Penny Lane (in Kansas City colors though, obviously) in a red shearling coat, which she styled with a black velvet vintage Chanel bucket hat. While we recognize the average Vogue reader may be a bit less invested in their fantasy football league than they are their fantasy creative director bracket, we can surely all appreciate the fashions that Swift brings to Kansas City. So, with that, follow along throughout the 2024-2025 NFL season as we chronicle every outfit Taylor Swift wears to cheer on the Kansas City Chiefs. Wearing a monogrammed Louis Vuitton jacket, bag, and shoes. Wearing a Charlotte Simone coat, vintage Chanel bucket hat, Tods bag, and Manolo Blahnik boots. In a Louis Vuitton half-zip sweater, Paige jeans, Dana Rebecca Designs hoops, and a custom “87” necklace. In a Chiefs jacket, corset top, knee-high Chrisitan Louboutin cowboy boots, Dior Saddle bag, and Chanel necklace. In Vivienne Westwood. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

The Best Dressed Stars of the Week Made Statements With Simplicity,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/10-best-dressed-stars-tyla-sydney-sweeney-cynthia-erivo,"January 26, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"From the fall 2025 men’s shows in Paris, to the annual Sundance Film Festival in Park City, there were plenty of splashy red carpet moments this week. The best dressed stars of the week, however, were those who leaned into simplicity rather than peacocking: Quiet, elegant looks made an impact thanks to interesting silhouettes and striking accessories. Turns out, subtle flourishes can have a high reward. In Paris, supermodel Kate Moss had the paparazzi going wild at the Dior show: She turned heads in the label’s simple silky white shirt dress. The look nodded back to the clean, unfussy designs of the ’90s—when she dominated the catwalks, of course. In New York City, Anora star Mikey Madison also did fresh suiting in a black tailoring look by The Row, complete with the customary white shirt and tie. (Classics are classics for a reason.) Other stars dialed up their pared-back outfits with skin-bearing hemlines. At the Jacquemus show, Tyla put her stamp on the naked dress, favoring a maxi gown with completely open sides. At the Louis Vuitton presentation, Sabrina Elba opted for a saucy mini leather dress by the brand, matching with husband Idris Elba in his leather trench. Two statements looks are better than one!

Tyla Redefines the Naked Dress at the Jacquemus Show,https://www.vogue.com/article/tyla-naked-dress-jacquemus-paris-fashion-week,"January 26, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Earlier today (January 26) in Paris, Jacquemus designer Simon Porte Jacquemus assembled a star-studded crowd to take in his new fall 2025 collection. Some notable names the front row? Best actress Oscar nominee and Last Showgirl star Pamela Anderson, supermodel Carla Bruni, and singer-of-the-moment Tyla, among others. (Adriana Lima even walked the catwalk.) While each star in attendance was sure to bring a polished look to the affair, it was Tyla who donned one of the most head-turning designs of the show. The “Water” singer put her stamp on the still-persisting naked dress trend, which is all about showing skin thanks to slinky barely-there silhouettes. While many celebrities have braved the trend on the red carpet this past year—with stars like Hailey Bieber and Zoe Kravitz choosing totally-sheer dresses in lace or crystal-encrusted mesh fabrications—Tyla brought a new, refined twist. She chose a long, black maxi gown by Jacquemus that was completely open along the sides, exposing the side torso and a thong-style brief, too. Still, with it being mostly covered up, the end result was a revealing look that still felt polished and sophisticated, right down to her choice of minimal earrings. After all, when your killer body is the accessory, you simply don’t need much else. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Bella Hadid Puts a Modern Twist on a Classic Penny Lane Coat,https://www.vogue.com/article/bella-hadid-penny-lane-coat,"January 26, 2025",By Christian Allaire,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Sure, 2000’s Almost Famous is now a cult classic movie—but 25 years later, we’re still stuck on Kate Hudson’s portrayal of the chic and alluring Penny Lane. Based on a real-life groupie, Penny is obsessed with following around bands on tour—and her wardrobe is equally as rockstar-worthy. Mainly, that shearling coat, which has since become a sartorial touchpoint for the film’s iconography (brought to life by costume designer Betsy Heimann). Even today, designers continue to put their stamp on the shearling-lined coat, including labels like Loewe and Acne Studios. Now, supermodel Bella Hadid has just served up a modern twist on the outerwear staple. Hadid was spotted at the West Side Helliport in New York City yesterday, January 25 (presumably to catch a private helicopter somewhere), and her cozy wintery look was completed by a vintage Dolce & Gabbana coat that was giving 2025 Penny Lane. The brown suede style, complete with a shaggy trim, was styled with brown leather knee boots—and is exactly the type of look that Penny would wear to a ’70s rock show. Hadid could not help but give the groovy ensemble an update with a checkered Louis Vuitton duffel bag, which came complete with a plushy bag charm—one of the hottest accessory trends of the moment. Even her giant tinted aviators, by Chanel, felt both retro and current. But it goes to show that a contemporary accessory, like a monogrammed and charmed-studded designer bag, will give even the most iconic throwback looks a fresh and timely feel.

Y2K Fashion 101: How the Millennium Started Trending All Over Again,https://www.vogue.com/article/y2k-fashion,"January 26, 2025",By Boutayna Chokrane,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. What comes after Y2K fashion? More Y2K fashion, of course! Picture this: a midriff-baring ribbed tank top paired with camouflage cargo pants, and a Fendi baguette bag nonchalantly slung over the shoulder; frayed denim shorts belted by a chunky round buckle, paired with strappy kitten heels and a Von Dutch trucker hat; a pink velour tracksuit with a Gothic font spelling NASTY in rhinestones across the rear, topped off with a pair of Matrix-style sunglasses. What might sound like fashion relics from a bygone era have been worn all over social media in recent years by many of the biggest models of the moment—and it’s a style revival that doesn’t seem to be disappearing any time soon. If you were dressing yourself in the early 2000s, you might feel some kind of way about Y2K fashion ruling the runways and the sidewalks once again. But if you weren’t? It’s entirely understandable that mining the annals of recent fashion history—and the vintage shops—would hold a certain appeal. For all its kitsch and camp, Y2K fashion is full of some intriguing gems. And anyway, fashion is cyclical. No era is immune to a remix now and again. Jennifer Lopez, 2000 Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, 2001 Before diving into Y2K fashion, it’s helpful to remember what was happening globally from 1999 to the early part of the 2000s. After all, Y2K is the shorthand way to write “the year 2000.” If the moniker conveys a certain futuristic brevity, that’s somewhat by design—it echoes the influence of the burgeoning digital age in the zeitgeist. It was the turn of the millennium and the future was on everyone’s mind. The tech advances were rolling out quick. In the year 2000, iPods, hybrid cars, camera phones, and GPS were introduced; iTunes, Wikipedia, and Xbox came in 2001. If that sounds cool, it definitely was—imagine going from a clunky CD player to a sleek iPod! But the promise of the new millennium also came with its share of existential dread. In fact, in 1999, “Y2K” was mostly associated a specific tech-induced panic related to the potential failure of the computer programs that ran banks, transportation, and power plants worldwide. “The Y2K bug was a computer flaw, or bug, that may have caused problems when dealing with dates beyond December 31, 1999,” National Geographic report . “The flaw, faced by computer programmers and users all over the world on January 1, 2000, is also known as the millennium bug.” Or, as the news anchors simply called it, “Y2K.” Luckily, the Y2K bug never ultimately resulted in major malfunctions—it was fixed just in time. But there was still plenty to come: One year later, we saw the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. Pop culture provided a distraction in the truest sense. Thus, the era was driven by MTV, reality television, talk shows, tabloid magazines, and—of course—celebrities. Their fashion antics came as quick as the tech: Jennifer Lopez wore her iconic green Versace dress on the Grammy Awards red carpet in 2000; Christina Aguilera wore a skimpy sequined number to the VMA’s the same year; Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears followed up the next with head-to-toe matching denim. The early 2000s was also a time where independent women were paving a sexy new path on shows like Sex and the City and Gilmore Girls; when reality shows like Survivor, America’s Next Top Model, and The Simple Life were must-see TV; and when the reality-bending film The Matrix had recently blown our minds. The first iterations of the Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings film franchises were also released. Beyoncé in Destiny’s Child, 2000 Sarah Jessica Parker in Sex and the City, 2000 Y2K fashion mirrored—and responded to—the uncertainty, fear, optimism, and novelty of the times with a can’t-stop-me-now attitude and a carefree, futuristic-retro vibe. The colors were bright and bold, the textures were metallic and shiny, the silhouettes were skin-baring and curve-hugging. Low-rise jeans, crop tops, and visible g-strings were designed to turn heads. Logomania and It-bags were obsessed over; as were sexy pumps, ballet flats, strappy sandals, and kitten-heeled mules. There were chunky sneakers, pointy-toed boots, and towering platform soles, too. Of course, the aughts weren’t solely about glitz and gaudy glam; It stole references from the 1960s and 1970s, too. These skin-baring styles were the precursor to the later, softer styles of the mid-aughts boho aesthetic, which took a page from the flower children of Laurel Canyon, Haight Ashbury, and the Woodstock. Think: peasant blouses, bolero sweaters, perforated belts, prairie dresses, retro prints, denim skirts, hobo bags, slouchy boots, and skinny scarves. As championed by celebrity stylist Rachel Zoe and worn by the likes of Sienna Miller, Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen, and Nicole Richie, the 2000s boho look was copied near and far—especially because it was easy to dupe as long as you knew how to layer. Whether it’s ballet flats, dresses over flares, or even the re-emergence of the grande dame of high-low Y2K fashion herself, Paris Hilton (who walked the Versace spring 2023 show), the garish glamour and head-spinning eclecticism of this divisive decade in fashion have become all but inescapable. So, too, have some of the decade’s most notorious brands, from the recent revival of Baby Phat to the rebirth of Juicy Couture to the resurgence of the Ugg through modish collaborations with the likes of Feng Chen Wang and Madhappy. Meanwhile, recent years marked the 20-year anniversaries of some of the most influential pop-culture phenomena of Y2K style, from The O.C. to One Tree Hill to That's So Raven. Even better: Some of those show’s stars have been enjoying newfound fame once again—Adam Brody in Nobody Wants This, anyone? So what prompted the re-emergence of Y2K fashion now? Like most current fashion trends, it started bubbling under—with a little help from Gen-Z influencers—on TikTok, where e-girls with retro hairstyles, beaded chokers, and butterfly clips have been happily dancing to “Mr Brightside” and lamenting that they were “born in the wrong decade.” It’s also a popular tag on every teenager’s favorite resale app, Depop, where it doesn’t take much trawling to find Miss Sixty jeans (a brand recently fronted by Bella Hadid), a Blink-182 T-shirt, or a pair of Skechers fetching hundreds of pounds. If this doesn’t make you feel old already, the fact that many of them are labelled as “vintage” might. Charli XCX at the Heaven by Marc Jacobs and Doja Cat Fall 2022 Party But it might not just be all about the youths. As it’s regularly pointed out, our current era is one of turmoil and uncertainty, too—pandemics, divisive elections, climate crisis, and global conflict—which may drive a penchant for nostalgia. “It makes sense that the aughts and Y2K fashion trends, potentially from a time when you were less stressed about the world, are back in the zeitgeist,” writer Jillian Wilson recently noted. As for Y2K’s absorption into the upper echelons of fashion, it’s perhaps little surprise that Marc Jacobs—one of the industry’s most reliable bellwethers—was among the first to embrace it. With his Heaven diffusion, launched in 2020 in collaboration with multi-hyphenate creative Ava Nirui as a more accessible counterpart to his mainline collections, Jacobs returned to a number of formative influences spanning the late ’90s and ’00s, such as the films of Gregg Araki and the Japanese street style of Shoichi Aoki’s Fruits magazine. “It’s very personal to me, because the first designer items that I owned were from Marc by Marc Jacobs. That was like the pinnacle of luxury for me at that time,” says Nirui. “This is the first trend that I’ve actually lived through and that I was a teenager for, so I feel super-connected to all of these vintage brands that are being recirculated,” she continues. Miu Miu, Spring 2024 This nostalgic appeal also holds true for Nicola Brognano, the 30-year-old designer who took the reins at the relatively stagnant house of Blumarine at the end of 2019, with ambitions to return the brand to the heights of its ’90s and ’00s heyday. For his spring 2023 collection, Brognano doubled down on a Y2k-meets-grunge aesthetic, with a shimmering abundance of flared low-rise jeans and sheer minidresses, reminiscent of the ocean’s siren-like allure. “I feel very close to that period because I grew up in those years, but I wanted to relive it with a modern sensibility,” Brognano says. “I wanted to show a collection that touches on happiness, sexiness, freedom. Something that breaks the rules, without being vulgar.” While the timing of the current noughties revival neatly fits the theory of trends operating on 20-year cycles, for Brognano it runs deeper than that: “It was the right moment to talk about it because people need happiness and carefree moments in their lives more than ever right now.” Blumarine, Spring 2023 Blumarine, Spring 2023 Brognano is onto something. Revivalism isn’t necessarily about creating a perfect facsimile of a look from a specific moment in time, but about pulling together a pastiche that reflects our needs and wants in the present day. How we understand the style of a decade really comes into focus only with hindsight, and the disparate elements of 2000s fashion that designers are pulling from to form a cohesive picture are largely those of pre-recession decadence and unbridled party-ready glamour. As Brognano puts it, “At a time like this, we’re all seeking joy where we can find it.” As Bruno Sialelli, the former creative director of Lanvin, sees it, the resurgence of interest in the Y2K aesthetic is a natural swinging of the pendulum, as a new generation moves up the ranks to become creative directors of some of the biggest fashion houses, revisiting their own youth in the process. “The revival of the ’00s is alive through talents that are from the same generation as me,” he told British Vogue in 2021. “To me personally, that era of MTV culture was very important. I was raised in the south of France, and as a teenager, that outlet was my access to culture. It was the way I discovered fashion, through musicians and actors.” Victoria Beckham, Spring 2025 Prada, Spring 2025 It’s hard to disagree: whether it’s Nicolas Ghesquière or Raf Simons revisiting the music and style of their teenage years in the ’80s, or the edgier corners of ’90s style that recur through the work of designers such as Casey Cadwallader and Glenn Martens, it’s only natural that a new guard of millennial designers should be working with the nostalgic touchstones of their own misspent youths. “We’re in a time where there’s shame associated with opulence and being over the top, so it feels almost radical in a way,” Sialelli says. Celebrities aren’t ready to give up the 2000s aesthetic, either. Ice Spice, the princess of rap and Gen Z’s It Girl, redefined streetwear with her ultra-girly McBling ensembles, reviving matching tracksuits, bedazzled baby tees, and bubblegum pink. Embracing a more nostalgic model-off-duty vibe, Hailey Bieber, Gigi Hadid, and Emily Ratajkowski swapped out their leather blazers for boxy bomber jackets. Anne Hathaway single-handedly brought back the controversial newsboy cap, and for those who have reservations regarding the return of Moon Boots, Rihanna owns a pair, so they must be trendy. Margot Robbie, 2023 Ice Spice, 2023 Bella Hadid, 2024 Of course, this resurgence of interest in the ’00s goes further than fashion. The fabulously tacky aesthetic revisited by designers has coincided with a broader cultural re-evaluation of the icons that populated that decade, and the thinly veiled misogyny of the tabloid press of that time. Whether it’s Britney Spears' memoir, The Woman in Me, which exposed the ruthlessness of the paparazzi and its impact on her mental health; the rebrand of Mattel’s Barbie; or the reassessment of the public perception of Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee’s relationship, it’s clear the lack of empathy afforded to the women whose style defined the decade was sometimes lost through fashion’s narrower lens. Yet while the less savory aspects of ’00s pop culture deserve to be left in the past, there’s a way in which the decade’s style makes a strange kind of sense for now. Y2K has been taken over by Gen Z, a cyber generation navigating the perpetual doom and gloom on social media. Their embodiment of the style reflects their internal conflict amid these times. On one hand, they’re angry, burdened by the sense of obligation to reverse the apocalyptic millennial mess. Simultaneously, they’re tired—tired of the pressure to be perfect, wanting to just let loose. Besides, who wouldn’t want to channel that Mean Girls-esque glitzy, so-bad-it’s-good glamour? So fetch! Paris Fashion Week, Spring 2025 Paris Fashion Week, Spring 2025 Not that you need to go full-on gaudy: As seen on the streets of Paris Fashion Week Spring 2025, there are plenty of ways to embrace the softer side of Y2K. Regardless of how you wear it—if at all—perhaps the reason the decade has made such a full-throated return lies in the simple fact that we’re all seeking to experience some fun in our fashion. Where the Roaring Twenties had flappers dripping with beads and feathers, there’s every chance we’ll be wearing glittering sequined crop tops, mini cardigans we crocheted ourselves, and baggy jeans slung dangerously low across our hips. So we’ll see you on the other side, living our very best Y2K fantasy on the dance floor. We’ve earned it. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Benito Skinner—aka Benny Drama—Braves the Rain for Dior (and Crêpes),https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/benito-skinner-benny-drama-dior-men-fall-2025-diary,"January 25, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Benito Skinner—the comedian and actor also known as Benny Drama—won’t let a little jet lag keep him down on the day of the Dior Men fall 2025 show. “I’m jet lagged at the moment, so this day started at 4 a.m. when I woke up and took down a box of chocolate biscuits,” he says. “I ate them in the dark :(.” Skinner was able to recover with breakfast at Carette and a stroll through the recently reopened Notre Dame Cathedral. Consider it the perfect start to an ideal morning. “I always love to take a walk, do some microcurrent or red light therapy on my face, and then drink coffee until I’m slightly sick,” he says. When it came to choosing his own look for the show, Skinner wanted to channel his inner Cary Grant. But in his everyday style, the comedian is all about striking a balance: Americana with whimsy, streetwear with formalwear. The mens show spoke to his sensibilities. “Kim’s blend of masculine pieces with the feminine DNA and silhouettes of Christian Dior is…my heaven,” he says. “And the play of sneakers with suits (especially bows) in this collection is exactly why I love his work at Dior. King!” Dior show aside, a perfect day in Paris is fairly simple for Skinner. “I’m the youngest child in my family so I truly will go anywhere someone tells me,” he says. “[I] LOVE a long dinner in Paris with at least six beverages (sparkling water into cocktails into Coke Zero into coffee…I’m getting chills writing this!). And maybe an afternoon in a museum before LA wakes up and starts emailing? That can be a really scary time of day.” While Skinner’s boyfriend Terrence O’Connor joined him in Paris, he one day hopes to return to the City of Light with O’Connor’s mother, who regularly features in sketches about their adversarial relationship. “Ok I SWEAR she’s the love of my life when I’m not making her be in a sketch, so I’d give her a break from my reign of terror,” he says. Luckily, he already has the agenda set. “The first thing we’re doing is buying scarves together. Doesn’t that sound nice? And we love splitting espresso martinis and gossiping so we would probably do that too. I can imagine her whipping her fresh bob around Paris…she could run this town!” Below, Benito Skinner takes Vogue along with him for the Dior Men fall 2025 show in Paris. I am sleepwalking here in a way <3 In this moment I didn’t know my boyfriend was going to use flash but I think I really pulled it together last minute. The scrambled eggs with cheese and ham and the fruit crepe…Daddy was eating good! Notre Dame is back and she’s beautiful. I won’t lie I had Esmeralda singing “God Help The Outcasts” in my head the entire time…Demi Moore forever. Icon living Brady Lea came to my hotel to get me glam for the show. He walked in and immediately put eye patches on…says a lot! For the hair we both came with the same reference—Cary Grant. I cropped this photo because I don’t think I’m ready for Vogue to see my perioral dermatitis… next time though, I promise! What’s in my bag :) Say hello to my new daughter! The Dior mini saddlebags are god tier. And yes, my phone background is my best friend Mary Beth Barone but with an age filter on. She’s always watching over me!

This Freaky-Chic Shoe Will Be Everywhere in 2025,https://www.vogue.com/article/freaky-chic-shoe-trend-2025,"January 25, 2025",By Julia Hobbs,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. I’m probably the furthest you can get from a barefoot runner, but I am the proud owner of a pair of Vibram FiveFingers glove shoes (in silver), which have been welded to my feet this winter. Fortunately, I’m not alone. There’s a growing cohort of FiveFingers Fashion Girls (see: model Paloma Elsesser, rap sensation Doechii, and The Attico co-founder Gilda Ambrosio) who are embracing the fitness world’s most divisive shoe. (Nike’s split-toe Air Rift revival comes in at a close second.) As I’ve personally discovered, Vibram’s lithe yoga footwear is surprisingly versatile and—sorry—grounding. I know, I know, but hear me out. In wardrobe terms, they dial up offbeat downtown chic when paired with cashmere legwarmers and friends who work in fashion that won’t get nauseous at the sight of all those toes—friends who witnessed the Tabi (RIP), long the fashion industry’s favourite freaky shoe, fall into the jaws of ubiquity. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. The five finger spin on the ballet slipper, on the other hand, has raised the stakes—both in terms of comfort and unbridled weirdness—as we stride into a new year laden with ambitions for enhanced wellbeing (while swerving the 100 pills-per-day “Don’t Die” regime) and “Denial is a River” on repeat. Here’s the thing: as is always the case with leftfield fashion trends that appear to rise up out of nowhere, the high fashion appropriation of Vibram toe shoes is signposting a collective mood shift in real time. The feeling in the air in January 2025: why be weighed down? Why wear heels? Why not get a little weirder, a little less hung up, a little more comfortable? Elsesser has the silver-grey VI-B ECO mesh flats, which are the chronically online second cousin of Alaïa’s viral mesh ballet shoe. Doechii demonstrates choreography on her IG Stories in toeless five finger Mary-Jane socks, and Ambrosio wears the black V-SOUL sports trainer with an ankle-grazing grey shearling coat, grey marl sweats and tube socks (it’s all very Miu Miu spring 2025). As for me, well, I’m counting down the days until Maximilian Davis’s Pilates-infused collection hits Ferragamo stores and, in the meantime, enjoying being nimble on my feet in Vibram flats and skinny Balmain jeans, albeit in the office and at dinner, rather than on the running track.

All the Best-Dressed Stars at Men’s Fashion Week,https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/all-the-best-dressed-stars-at-mens-fashion-week,"January 24, 2025",By Daniel Rodgers,"The fall 2025 menswear season began with several of Milan’s most prominent brands–Gucci, Fendi, JW Anderson, Moschino, DSquared2, and Versace–conspicuously absent from the schedule. The shows, as a result, have seen fewer headline-grabbing appearances from celebrities than usual, while those guests in attendance seemed more restrained, offering fewer of the viral soundbites that magazine editors like to chase before the house lights dim. Is it down to an industry still reeling from the devastating Los Angeles wildfires, or has culture finally graduated from the “What’s your ick?” style of front-row reporting? There’s nothing wrong with a boldface cameo, of course, but perhaps we could all do without seeing another Netflix star strong-armed into naming the soundtrack to their lives. I arrived at the Prada show with a list of such questions, but was quietly grateful when Harris Dickinson, Louis Patridge, and Joseph Quinn politely demurred, conserving their time for Mrs. P and Raf Simons only. While a fashion week co-sign can often serve as a profile-boosting exercise, it appeared as though these guests were invited primarily to appreciate, and animate, the clothes themselves. (Let’s see how long this lasts.) Elsewhere, Giorgio Armani enlisted Cooper Koch, Adrien Brody, and Joe Alwyn as pop cultural ambassadors, while James McAvoy popped up at Dolce & Gabbana and Mads Mikkelsen at Zegna. The Paris collections, which just kicked off with Louis Vuitton, will host even more. Scroll down below for a run down of the best-dressed stars at the fall 2025 menswear shows.

Is That Sarah Jessica Parker or Carrie Bradshaw at Sundance?,https://www.vogue.com/article/sarah-jessica-parker-carrie-bradshaw-sundance-film-festival,"January 24, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"What if Sex And The City traded New York for Park City? Sarah Jessica Parker hit the Utah streets ahead of the 2025 Sundance Film Festival dressed in a look that could just as easily belong on Carrie Bradshaw. The actor is at Sundance to promote her documentary, The Librarians, but given her Carrie-core outfit, we’d just as easily believe she was shooting a scene for And Just Like That… Parker emulated her character’s haphazard, layering-heavy looks, pairing a voluminous dress with a parka—a trend all over the spring 2025 runways (one that my colleague José Criales-Unzueta did indeed note was very Bradshaw-esque). Parker centered her outfit around a charcoal gray Meruert Tolegen dress that featured a corseted top and a full ruffled skirt with black tulle peaking out from underneath. Undeterred by the winter temperatures, she layered the dress over a dark blue button-up. But the layering didn’t stop there! SJP bundled up in a chunky gray knit cardigan and a black parka. Though, true to form for both Parker and her alter ego, she left all of her jackets open because fashion comes first. No Carrie-core outfit is complete without some extreme accessorizing—namely in the shoe department. But there are no Manolos here. Instead, she wore a pair of knee-high fuchsia suede boots from her discontinued Sarah Jessica Parker line, along with a pair of skiing-appropriate goggle sunglasses. SJP finished off the look with some ladylike touches: a gray quilted Chanel bag and a string of pearls. Carrie would more than certainly approve.

Kate Moss Will Never Abandon Her Signature Faux-Fur Jacket,https://www.vogue.com/article/kate-moss-signature-faux-fur-jacket,"January 24, 2025",By Hannah Jackson,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Just one week after her 51st birthday, Kate Moss is rewearing a piece of her party look. Today, the supermodel was spotted leaving the Ritz Hotel in Paris for the Dior mens fall 2025 show, where she sat between actor Gwendoline Christie and fencer Miles Chamley-Watson. For Kim Jones’ show, Moss wore a white silk dress that played on a button-down, featuring two rows of buttons, an asymmetrical hemline, and a peekaboo black lace bra. She paired the dress with ultra-sheer black tights, black pumps, a heaping stack of mixed-metal bracelets, and a chain necklace. For some extra pizzazz, Moss carried a leopard print bucket bag. Leaving the Ritz Paris. The real star of the show, however, was the black faux-fur jacket Moss wore to her London birthday party last week. The eye-catching jacket—with an assist from the leopard print bag—gave Moss’s ladylike outfit a naughty edge. (For anyone still obsessed with reviving the indie sleaze era, let this live on your moodboard.) While we saw this jacket as recently as last week, it’s been a staple in the model’s closet for over 20 years. She’s had it since at least 2003, when she wore it to the Dazed and Confused Exhibition in London. This actually isn’t even the first time she wore it to a Dior show: for the spring 2011 runway, she styled it with a black top and black leather skirt. Kate Moss is living proof that our clothes can last a lifetime. In her case, this black faux-fur coat can carry her from birthdays to runways.

How to Wash Cashmere for Long-Lasting Elegance,https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-wash-cashmere,"January 24, 2025",By Emily Chan,"Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. We know that cashmere can have a large environmental impact—which is why it’s extra important that we look after our luxurious knits to ensure they stand the test of time. But how exactly should we be washing our cashmere? And what are the best ways to look after our jumpers long-term? Below, Vogue speaks to the experts for their top tips on how to wash and care for our cashmere. While many of us are nervous about machine washing cashmere, lest it shrinks, Oyuna Tserendorj, founder of London-based cashmere brand Oyuna, says that we don’t need to be. “Cashmere can definitely be washed in a washing machine on a wool setting at 30 degrees,” she says, although she suggests that you don’t put your most expensive cashmere pieces in the wash right away. “If you’re new to machine washing cashmere, test with a less precious item first, as washing machine settings can vary.” Instead of using regular detergent, Tserendorj uses her own organic shampoo, noting that you don’t need to buy special cashmere products. For those who still aren’t sure about machine washing, hand washing is of course an option. “I tend to soak the piece in warm water with a bit of detergent and gently hand wash, then refill the sink with clear water to rinse,” says Johnstons of Elgin CEO Chris Gaffney, who likes to use Clothes Doctor’s cashmere and wool detergent. “I then pop the piece into the machine on a spin cycle to take out most of the moisture, but this can also be done by gently wringing the water out.” When it comes to drying your cashmere, make sure you shape it first. While Tserendorj leaves her cashmere pieces on a drying rack, Gaffney likes to lie his flat on a towel, adding: “You don’t want to leave it lying out of shape soaking wet for too long, and I would never tumble dry.” Another dilemma is whether to hand wash or dry clean our cashmere. Gaffney says that washing can actually increase the softness of our cashmere garments over their lifetime. However, he notes that “woven fabric needs to be dry cleaned,” while dry cleaning is also recommended “for some special heavier pieces, or very fine yarns.” If in doubt, it’s best to check the care label. This is down to personal preference: some experts say twice a season, while others suggest every three or four wears. The bottom line? You probably don’t need to wash your cashmere as much as you think you do. “Cashmere is a natural fibre, so it loves sunlight and fresh air,” Tserendorj says. “Place it outside, or on a warm radiator, to freshen up in the winter.” While most cashmere will pill to some degree, it’s less likely to be an issue with better-quality garments, “as longer cashmere fibres are used in better garments, and the quality of yarn spinning and knitting tension help too,” Gaffney explains. “Generally pilling will reduce over time as the shorter fibres come out.” To tackle any bobbly bits, you can use lint rollers or even shavers, although Gaffney recommends a specialist cashmere comb. To ensure your cashmere lasts, it’s of course crucial to store your pieces properly to keep the moths at bay. Before putting them away, Tserendorj recommends washing to remove any food remnants or strong perfume from your garments. “Then put away in a cloth bag, ideally with a cedar block,” the expert continues. “If you discover moths, put your garment in the freezer for 48 hours, which should kill the moths, and then wash as above and store away.” More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

"Bella Hadid Knows: When in Doubt, Wear Your Sister’s Clothes",https://www.vogue.com/article/bella-hadid-leggings-puffer,"January 24, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"Dressing for the New York cold spell is tough. Sydney Sweeney’s week in NYC was swathed in sumptuous capes, shearling coats, and chic trenches by way of Ferragamo, Burberry, and Chloe. But Bella Hadid has returned from the (marginally) more temperate Texas with a sartorial plan of action. First, she ensconced herself in a tighter fitting denim: a signal toward the skinny jean revival, and a practical, warmer choice of jean compared to roomier, breezier styles. Now, she’s turned to her big sister Gigi Hadid’s wardrobe. The model was photographed leaving Gigi’s home in NoHo, New York in a casual fit: a black zip-up and top, Tona leggings, pull-on boots, and a black and blue reversible knit and quilted puffer jacket from her sister’s brand Guest in Residence. When in doubt, little sisters know they have a second wardrobe ready and waiting… She kept it laidback with her hair pulled up in a tight bun and secured with a black headband, with oval-shaped sunglasses, and silver hoop earrings. The humble legging has become a practical and—dare I say it—chic go-to among the girls in the know this season, and as our silhouettes get close-fitting once again. Kendall Jenner wore her leggings with riding boots and a furry hat in Aspen. But this is also a bit of a throwback to Hadid’s pilates princess era fits, when you’d often catch her in Victoria’s Secret bralettes and baggy Nike nylons. A far cry, too, from her current Western-indebted wardrobe filled with chaps, Stetsons, and vintage cowboy boots. Needs must though. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2025 Condé Nast.

How Putricia the Blooming Corpse Flower—the Internet’s Stinkiest It Girl—Should Dress for Her Coming Out,https://www.vogue.com/article/putricia-blooming-corpse-flower-australia,"January 23, 2025",By Anna Cafolla,"She first appeared to me soundtracked by Angelo Badalamenti’s enchanting Twin Peaks theme. She was on a stage, flanked by relatives, friends, and successors, with smoke swirling around her base. A snaking queue hundreds of people long had lined up to see—and smell—her. Popping up on my FYP, all three meters of her, was Putricia the Corpse Flower, the Botanic Gardens of Sydney’s Araceae It girl. To the scientific community, Putricia is known as amorphophallus titanum—derived from the Ancient Greek for “giant misshapen penis.” Part of an endangered species of plant, she’s one of only 1,000 left in the world, and, of the several titan arums in Sydney’s Royal Botanic Gardens, the first to bloom in more than 15 years. So, Putricia has become a major event. I’ve been following along on TikTok and via livestream, while thousands more have turned up to her Sydney home to see her in all her glory. Right now, it’s said she smells like rotting flesh, but as she unfurls and shows her crimson, velvety insides, the smell from her long yellow spadix will only intensify. And already, a rival has emerged: another corpse flower has begun to bloom at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the first in New York. It’s roughly six foot tall. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. As one of Putricia’s self-described “handmaids” shared, the Corpse Flower’s throne was variously inspired by Queen Victoria’s opulent funeral setting, Little Shop of Horrors, the work of David Lynch, some Gothic funeral parlor vibes, and vintage sideshows. The palm house in which she resides actually dates back to the Victorian age, though it has since been fit out with a red carpet, a guard of honor made up of other botanicals and plant life, and Putricia herself, lying in state on a raised stage. Puffs of mist float around her to mirror the wet, humid rainforests of the island of Sumatra, where the corpse flower is originally from, and a sign states her name in medieval font. It’s clear we’re witnessing another society debut—which made us wonder what, ideally, Putricia would wear for the occasion. How does one approach the outfitting of a force of nature, a star in her field (or forest)? If we’re to lean into Putricia’s horticultural roots, she could take a leaf out of Amelia Gray Hamlin’s book and copy her 2024 Met Gala look. Perfectly suited to the “Garden of Time” herself, Putricia could don the light-up terrarium dress from Jun Takahashi’s Undercover spring/summer 2024 show, its diaphanous fabric encasing her own unfurling leaves (or incorporating some of her smaller cousins). Simone Rocha’s bouquet-embellished bodices and sheer, sheath dresses of spring 2025 are also rich in interpretation for the floral of the moment—as are Sandy Liang’s visions of girlhood and coquette core. (Putricia could definitely pull off a pink satin sash.) The picture of a Lynchian muse, Putricia could also explore her more sensory, sumptuous side: Think black bodycon and crushed, textured fabrics by way of Laura Dern and Isabella Rossellini in Blue Velvet. Or, go spookier: If she’s indeed as confident as she presents, she could have a Comme des Garçons moment. A taste for textures that depart from her planty waxiness could move Putricia in the direction of a Rodarte spring 2025 princess, wearing a regal gown that reflects like molten metal. Should she want more drama, Seán McGirr’s sophomore collection for Alexander McQueen has yet more gilded, romantic evening wear that hits the right avant-garde and otherworldly notes—like the silvery dress worn by Angelina Jolie at the 2025 Golden Globes. Alternatively, Putricia could pay homage to her adopted home and opt for a look from an Australian designer like Christopher Esber; a good number of his sheer, figure-hugging silhouettes have enough liquidity in the draping to keep her quenched. This will be a short and sharp promotion run: After a few days, the flower’s structure will shrivel and collapse. Eventually, a single new leaf will be produced, but it may be years before Putricia has the energy to flower again. In many ways, it’s a tale as old as time; our most iconic It girls have often flashed before our eyes. But Putricia’s putrid smell will surely linger.
